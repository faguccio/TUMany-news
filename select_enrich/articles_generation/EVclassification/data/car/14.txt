The hot Kia EV6 GT will be updated with the powertrain from the closely related Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, bringing a significant increase in power. 

The dual-motor, four-wheel-drive set-up puts out 601bhp and 545lb ft of torque in normal operation, but this temporarily increases to 641bhp and 568lb ft when the car’s GT drive mode is selected.

Those outputs are an increase on the 576bhp and 545lb ft of the outgoing EV6 GT.

Kia has yet to clarify how this affects the car’s straight-line performance, but it is likely to improve on the outgoing car’s 0-62mph sprint time of 3.5sec. For reference, Hyundai claims that the Ioniq 5 N takes 3.4sec.

The new EV6 GT also gets the simulated automatic gearbox used in the Ioniq 5 N and its bigger sibling, the Kia EV9 GT. This emulates the gearing and power delivery of a combustion-engined performance car, limiting torque and changing the sound played through the speakers according to the ‘engine’ revs and gear. It can be operated in a conventional automatic mode (and disabled entirely for a more typical electric driving experience), or it can be manually operated using paddles located behind the steering wheel.

As well as extra power and tactility, the new EV6 GT gets a 84kWh battery pack, up from 77kWh in the outgoing model. That should improve its range slightly from the previous car’s official rating of 263 miles between charges.

Kia has yet to release pictures of the new EV6 GT, but it is expected to receive the styling tweaks that were applied to the milder variants of the electric crossover earlier this year. That means a revised look inspired by the EV3, EV5 and EV9, plus an updated interior with a new three-spoke steering wheel.

It’s expected to arrive in the UK early next year and prices are likely to represent a slight increase on the outgoing model's. For reference, that car started at £62,675.

Best EV I've been in, and that was just the normal version. This will be outstanding - hopefully they haven't firmed up the ride too much.

Not impressed?, no, me neither, the power and torque are so easy obtained, the power is now a family sized car for not, well at least today, not a lot of money for performance was once a Supercar domain,so 600+ hp is a bit meh.
