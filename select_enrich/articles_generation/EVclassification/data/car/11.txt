SC63
With just one FIA World Endurance Championship season under its belt and no race wins, Lamborghini is already pulling its SC63 out of the competition for next year, citing a ‘change in sporting regulations’ as the reason. Toys, say goodbye to your pram.

The new rule states that each team competing in the WEC's Hypercar class must enter at least two cars for the 2025 campaign, which Lambo… isn’t too keen on doing, apparently. Instead it’ll focus on continuing development of the SC63 in the IMSA SportsCar Championship in the US.

It's not just the Hypercar class that Lambo is leaving though. It's also pulling its LMGT3 cars out of the 2025 WEC season, although it says that this will allow its Squadra Corse division to finish up development of the new Temerario GT3, which is due for its public debut next year.

Lamborghini's factory Iron Lynx team only managed to finish eighth out of nine entrants in the WEC Manufacturers' Championship in 2024, securing just 11 points from eight races in the Hypercar class.

The team did finish in the top 10 (well, tenth) at Le Mans though, which is some sort of consolation. Looked supremely cool too, so we'll still be keeping an eye out for the SC63 on the other side of the Atlantic.
