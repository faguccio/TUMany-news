At the Los Angeles auto show, Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa confirmed that a replacement for the compact Cherokee SUV is coming next year.
Filosa also confirmed that the new SUV will feature a hybrid powertrain.
It's unclear if this will be a plug-in hybrid like the Grand Cherokee 4xe and the Wrangler 4xe.
Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has announced that a new compact SUV will arrive in 2025 packing a hybrid powertrain, as reported by Automotive News. Filosa made the announcement at the Los Angeles auto show, and we expect the new crossover to revive the Cherokee nameplate.

The Jeep Cherokee was once among the brand's most popular models, but Jeep let the Cherokee wither on the vine and eventually unceremoniously discontinued the compact SUV after the 2023 model year. Earlier this year, Filosa announced that a new "mainstream" D-segment SUV model was on its way, hinting that we "could probably guess what it will be called."

If the Cherokee nameplate does indeed return as we expect, this would mark the first time the moniker has been attached to a hybrid powertrain. It's also unclear if this model will be a plug-in hybrid or a traditional hybrid without the ability to travel exclusively on electric power or recharge the battery by plugging in. Jeep currently sells two plug-in hybrid models, the Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe, in the United States. Filosa said that the platform the Cherokee replacement will ride on will allow Jeep to develop an electric version later if the market for such a model grows.
