Hyundai, Kia and Genesis recalled 200,000 EVs due to a faulty 12-volt battery charging system.
The issue could cause affected vehicles to lose power while driving, creating a potentially dangerous situation.
It affects the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6; Kia EV and Genesis Electrified G80, Electrified GV70 and GV60.
Hyundai, Kia and Genesis are recalling over 200,000 EVs over an issue that could cause them to suddenly lose power, according to notices filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Reuters was the first to report the news of the Hyundai recall, but InsideEVs has confirmed it affects some Kias, too.

The recall covers 145,234 Hyundai and Genesis EVs, along with 62,872 Kia EV6s. The covered vehicles have an issue with their Integrated Charging Control Units (ICCUs), which is responsible for charging the low-voltage 12-volt battery using power from the high-voltage system. The ICCU is a common failure point on Hyundai, Genesis and Kia EVs on the E-GMP platform, and if it fails it'll stop charging the 12-volt battery. The 12-volt going flat can lead to a loss of drive power, causing the car to suddenly lose power and speed. Here is the full list of affected vehicles:

2022-2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5
2023-2025 Hyundai Ioniq 6
2022-2024 Kia EV6
2023-2024 Genesis Electrified G80
2023-2025 Genesis Electrified GV70
2023-2025 Genesis GV60

Owners have reported losing power on the freeway, resulting in the car suddenly dropping far below highway speeds before stopping entirely.  

"I was driving on the highway and a message appeared that said 'check electrical system.' The power in the car then completely bottomed out and I could not go above 25 mph," one 2024 Ioniq 5 AWD owner reported in a public comment to NHTSA.

NHTSA opened an investigation into the 2022 Ioniq 5 back in early summer 2023, over the same issue. A month later, the agency opened a similar probe over the issue in the 2022 Kia EV6. Many EV6s and Ioniq 5s were already recalled over this issue, but apparently the fix didn't work. So Hyundai, Kia and Genesis are recalling all previously affected vehicles, plus additional ones not subject to the earlier recall.

If you own one of the affected vehicles, your dealer will check your ICCU and its fuse, replacing both if necessary. The dealer will also update the ICCU's software. You will need this recall even if your vehicle was previously subject to the ICCU recall. As with all recalls, you will be notified directly, and the work will be performed free of charge.

Why on earth would anyone buy a Kia or Hyundai EV when they can't even get a gas engine right?
