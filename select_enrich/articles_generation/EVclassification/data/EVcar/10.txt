Closing out this week’s Green Deals, we have a nice mix of Black Friday deals on backup power solutions, affordable EVs, and plenty of marked down lawn care equipment. Starting us off is the full Black Friday sale from Anker SOLIX that is taking up to $4,434 off units and bundles, like the C300 90,000mAh Power Stations that are returning to their lowest prices starting from $140. Heybike has launched its next weekend flash sale through Sunday that is taking its Mars 2.0 Folding e-bike to an $899 low. We have three different brands of lawn care equipment getting some major savings, with Worx’s Nitro LEAFJET Cordless Leaf Blower hitting a new $94 low, while EGO Power+ has its Select Cut 21-inch 56V mower with a 10Ah battery down at $700, among others. Lastly, Segway is taking up to $600 off its Navimow H series and i series Robot Lawn Mowers that start from $799. Plus, all the other hangover Green Deals are in the links at the bottom of the page, like yesterday’s exclusive low prices on Anker’s SOLIX F3800 power station and bundle, the full Jackery Black Friday sale, and more.

Head below for other New Green Deals we’ve found today and, of course, Electrek’s best EV buying and leasing deals. Also, check out the new Electrek Tesla Shop for the best deals on Tesla accessories.

Anker SOLIX switches to full Black Friday savings with return lows on C300 90,000mAh stations from $140, more
Anker’s SOLIX Black Friday sale has officially switched over to its full savings through November 29, giving you a chance at up to $4,434 in savings across a lineup of power stations, solar generators, and home backup bundles. There have been some updates to its early sales period and we noticed the brand’s new C300 90,000mAh Portable Power Stations hitting new low prices, with the C300 DC power station down at $139.99 shipped (matching at Amazon) and the C300 AC power station falling to $179.99 shipped (also matching at Amazon). Normally costing you either $200 or $250, respectively, we’ve only seen these rates once before, back during last month’s Prime Day event, with today’s 30% markdowns returning to slash $60 and $70 off the going rates. You’ll be getting a second chance at the best prices we’ve tracked here until Black Friday ends, as well as the opportunity to be prepared with backup power for your personal devices on trips, for everyday use, and even in an emergency. You’ll also find the brand’s new (and smaller) C200 DC 60,000mAh power station at $110, down from $170, if you wanted to save a little more too.

As a reminder, Anker is also providing free gear on purchases that reach certain thresholds. Orders over $3,000 will receive a free 200W solar panel, while orders over $4,000 will get a free EverFrost Portable Cooler 40, and orders over $5,500 will get a free 400W solar panel.

The Anker SOLIX C300 power stations build upon the successes of the PowerCore Reserve with a 90,000mAh/288Wh capacity that’s been upgraded with LiFePO4 cells. The DC model provides you with up to a 300W output for your devices through its seven ports, while reaching 280W for its self-recharging thanks to the two bi-directional 140W USB ports being used together at once. There’s also an integrated LED pop-up light on top that helps with illumination needs when you’re stuck in the dark. The AC model doesn’t boast the dual USB charging, instead reaching the same recharging speeds with one port alone plugged into a wall outlet. This model has eight port options (with it obviously having three AC ports), and has traded the pop-up light for a light bar. You can also score either of these two models with a 60W solar panel at new low prices of $190 and $230.

Heybike’s latest weekend flash sale drops its Mars 2.0 folding e-bike by $600 to $899 low for first time since February
Heybike’s Black Friday sale is well into the swing of its savings game and for the third time so far we’re getting a weekend flash sale through Sunday on the brand’s Mars 2.0 Folding Fat-Tire e-bike at $899 shipped. Usually sitting at its $1,499 full price outside of sales, this upgraded model has mainly seen discounts take costs down to $1,099 or higher, with a few select drops to $999. Today’s deal is hands-down the best we’ve tracked, which we haven’t seen reappear since February. You’ll be saving $600 here, along with a Black Friday gift pack at the all-time lowest price.

Heybike’s Mars 2.0 e-bike rolls into view with four colorway options at 28 MPH top speeds with its 750W motor – plus the 48V battery delivers a solid 45-mile travel range to boot. There is an option to upgrade to a 1,000W motor for an increased 32 MPH speed along with other performance boosts, but keep in mind it’ll tack on an additional $200 to the price tag. It offers five levels of pedal assistance to support you through longer travels, plus a nice array of features at such a low price. Alongside the foldable frame, you’ll also enjoy 4-inch fat tires for better stability and smoother rides, as well as hydraulic disc brakes for improved stopping power. There’s also a headlight and taillights with brake light functionality, a rear cargo rack, a shock-absorbing saddle, and a smart LCD display.

Anker SOLIX Black Friday
Grab Worx’s Nitro LEAFJET cordless leaf blowers for your yard at new Black Friday lows starting from $94
As part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, Amazon is offering a Lightning Deal on the Worx Nitro 20V LEAFJET Cordless Leaf Blower for $93.99 shipped. Normally going for $170 at full price, it’s been seeing more frequent discounts in the second half of the year, with last month’s Prime Day event dropping costs to the former $95 low. That price is getting beaten here today though, as it comes in with a solid 45% markdown that saves you $76 and beats out the former low price by $1.

The Nitro 20V LEAFJET comes equipped by Worx with its brushless 2.0 motor tech and has a sonic turbine fan powered by a 4.0Ah battery, giving it a forceful jet stream of air output for your debris-clearing needs. It has a two-speed control (high and low) and two differing power modes: the volume mode clears wider areas at 410 CFM, while the speed mode produces a more concentrated airflow for heavier debris in your yard. You can also find its more powerful 40V counterpart benefitting from a 40% markdown to $151.

More Worx Black Friday deals:
4V 3-Speed Cordless Screwdriver: $23 (Reg. $40)
12A TRIVAC 3-in-1 Electric Leaf Blower/Mulcher/Vacuum: $65 (Reg. $79)
GT3.0 20V 12-inch String Trimmer/Edger with two batteries: $98 (Reg. $140)

And much more…

Amazon takes $149 off EGO Power+ Select Cut 21-inch 56V mower with 10Ah battery at $700, more from $143
As part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, Amazon is offering the EGO Power+ Select Cut 21-inch 56V Self-Propelled Lawn Mower with 10Ah battery for $699.99 shipped. This combination of mower and battery would normally cost you $849 most of the time, with discounts slowing since mid-June, though we did see it hit the $649 all-time low before that in April. Today, thanks to the Black Friday savings, the price has gone the lowest we’ve seen in five months, saving you $149 off its going rate at the third-lowest price we have tracked.

Many folks are constantly on the hunt for an electric mower at an affordable rate to replace their old, worn out gas guzzlers, and this is a great opportunity as EGO Power+ is considered one of the best makers of such equipment – plus, this is quite the treat to grab it with a larger-than-normal 10Ah battery that provides a full 75 minutes of runtime. The 21-inch cutting deck comes self-propelled to assist in maneuvers around the yard, while its Select Cut multi-blade system offers interchangeability and a six-position cutting height adjustment between 1.5 inches and 4 inches. It even delivers three options of functionality, allowing you to choose between mulching, rear-bagging, or side discharges – all starting up at the press of a button for simplicity’s sake.

Anker SOLIX Black Friday
Segway’s Black Friday sale takes up to $600 off Navimow H and i series robot lawn mowers starting from $799
Coming to us through its official Amazon storefront alongside its direct site, Segway has launched its full Black Friday savings across its Navimow H series and i series robot lawn mowers, with the Navimow H series models mostly discounted at Amazon starting from $1,299 shipped, with the other two models discounted to $1,599 and $1,999 – the latter of which can be found direct from Segway’s website matching this rate. These three higher-end models are coming down from their $1,899, $2,199, and $2,599 full price tags now, with most of the brand’s sales cutting the prices by $380 to $600 throughout the year. We last saw these $600 markdowns during last month’s Prime Day event, with them coming back around today to give you the lowest price we have tracked.

There are three slightly differing models within Segway’s Navimow H series – one designed to tackle yards up to 0.2 acres in size, one for 0.37 acres, and the last one covering 0.74 acres. The smallest one provides its services with a 180-minute runtime on a single charge, while the other two have longer 240-minute battery lives. All three deliver equal cutting height ranges from 1.2 inches to 2.4 inches, with the power to overcome 24-degree slopes with ease, as well as IP66 waterproof ratings to stand up against adverse elements, especially after inclement weather.

Unlike many competitor models on the market, the robot’s under Segway’s brand trade in the need for a perimeter wire to instead focus on RTK positioning, which works alongside the included VisionFence Sensor for enhanced navigation and obstacle avoidance. While you can certainly take over its performance through the array of smart controls, you can also just leave it to its own autonomous routines that you set, with it even returning to its charging station when the battery gets too low, starting where it left off once its back to a full battery. This is possible thanks to the guidance of its Global Navigation Satellite Systems that make sure to keep it within the set boundaries and also to track it down if it gets stuck on terrain or even swiped off your property when you’re not looking.

The brand’s two i series robot lawn mowers are also seeing repeating low prices with these savings, with one model tailored for 1/8-acre yards at $799 and matching at Amazon, while the other covers 1/4 acres at $1,039, also matching at Amazon. You’ll be receiving the same smart functionality, RTK navigation, and obstacle avoidance as the above H series models, and can get a full idea of what to expect when they arrive by reading our original announcement coverage from the beginning of the year.
