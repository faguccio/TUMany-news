Mercedes tech may enable EV batteries with mixed cell types
Joel Feder Joel Feder November 22, 2024 1 Comment
Mercedes-Benz has its eyes on solid-state batteries with its partnership with Factorial for battery cells, but the automaker's already thinking one step beyond that.

In the future, Mercedes envisions mixed battery packs with different types of cells all wired in parallel rather than today's series arrangement. The enabling factor to this is a new micro-converter the automaker's developing in-house to replace today's electrical inverter systems.

In Germany, Mercedes engineers showed working prototypes to Green Car Reports of the programmable micro-converters. The converters are about the length of a stick of gum and twice the width. They looked light and were encased in black plastic, but engineers were sure to keep us from touching the (presumably expensive) prototypes.

The micro-converters can be connected directly to any number of cell pairs. This enables engineers to program and control individual cell pairings independently regardless of the state-of-charge. Engineers demonstrated this on a workbench, putting the mixed test cells under load and then independently turning on and off certain cell pairings.

Engineers said the new micro-converters open the possibility to mix-and-match cell types, chemistries, and more for various situations. The converters could enable a pack to have LFP cells, NMC cells, and solid-state cells all together, and they could call upon different types of cells for different conditions and situations to work in their optimal operating windows. That could open a new door for performance vehicles for the automaker's AMG division.

The new approach could translate to faster charging rates, longer driving range, and more flexibility in pack design, according to Mercedes' engineers.

Mercedes-Benz paid for travel and lodging for Green Car Reports to bring you this information.
