Electric Chrysler Pacifica minivan plays with flexible interior

Chrysler's inching closer to an electric minivan, and now we know what it will be called.

On Thursday at the 2024 LA Auto Show, Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell confirmed to Green Car Reports that the upcoming electric Chrysler minivan will bear the Pacifica name.

"There's so much equity in the market, consumers have a favorable opinion about Pacifica and very high awareness. I see no reason at this point to change the name," Feuell said.

In 2022 at the New York Auto Show, Feuell told GCR the automaker was rethinking the minivan for the electric era. That future is coming quickly.

In 2026 the Pacifica will receive a refresh, according to Feuell. The updated design will set the stage for the electric Pacifica that will follow, likely a year later.

Chrysler will not use the design direction set by the Airflow electric SUV concept. Feuell said the brand's design identity will take design cues from the Halcyon concept shown in February. "Modern" and "futuristic" were the design terms Feuell used for Chrysler's design direction.

Feuell wouldn't commit to whether the Pacifica Hybrid with its plug-in hybrid powertrain will coexist alongside the electric Pacifica. The executive also wouldn't comment on whether an electric Pacifica with a range extender, like the Ram Charger EREV pickup truck, would make sense.

Electric Chrysler Pacifica getting flexible seating
Feuell was quick to note that with the VW ID.Buzz–the first electric minivan to hit the U.S. market–you have to remove the seats entirely to create an open space.

The Chrysler team's been working up creative ways to reimagine the automaker's patented Stow 'N Go seating system with a BEV powertrain. Feuell noted one option is pushing the front seats forward to create a clever cargo space under the front seats to store the second row. The executive also mentioned looking at the outboard seating positions in the second row and perhaps putting them on rails to slide sideways.

No final interior configuration for the reconfigurable seating has been locked in yet, according to Feuell. But the planning stages are advanced enough that suppliers are now involved in the discussion to understand what's possible.

Feuell said the team's looking at the use cases and how customers will want to use the space. From lounging while waiting for their kid's soccer practice is done to camping or having a picnic or tailgating, it's all on the table. There's also a focus on how to load and unload cargo along with ingress, egress, and cargo liftover height.
