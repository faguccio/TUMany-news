            <h2>Global EV Incentive Programs: Sparking the Electric Surge</h2>
            <p>The global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is being accelerated by an array of <strong>incentive programs</strong> designed to make EV ownership more accessible and attractive. From <em>subsidies and tax rebates</em> to free charging and parking, countries around the world are competing to become leaders in this automotive transformation.</p>
            <p>In Norway, for example, EV buyers enjoy a range of benefits including <span style="background-color: yellow;">exemption from VAT</span> and reduced road tolls, contributing to over 70% of new car sales being electric. Similarly, China has implemented robust incentives like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">purchase subsidies</span> and the development of an extensive charging network, aiming to dominate the EV market.</p>

            <h2>Clean Vehicle Policy: Paving the Road to Sustainability</h2>
            <p>Governments worldwide are enacting <strong>policies</strong> to phase out gasoline and diesel vehicles, promoting a shift towards electric mobility. The European Union, for instance, has proposed a ban on new fossil-fuel car sales by 2035, aligning with its climate neutrality goals.</p>
            <p>Moreover, cities like London and Paris are implementing <em>low-emission zones</em> to reduce urban pollution, further incentivizing the adoption of EVs. These policies are pivotal in fostering an environment conducive to electric vehicle growth.</p>
