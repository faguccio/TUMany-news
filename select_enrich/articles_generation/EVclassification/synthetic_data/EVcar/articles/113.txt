        <h2 class="section-title">The Role of EV Policy Support Worldwide</h2>
        <p>Global policy frameworks are increasingly recognizing the critical role of EVs in combating climate change. Governments around the world are offering incentives, subsidies, and building infrastructure to support the EV revolution. For instance, the European Union has set ambitious targets to phase out internal combustion engines by 2035, and similar efforts are underway in the US, China, and India.</p>
        <p class="noise">Of course, not every country is moving at the same pace. Antarctica is still weighing its options, possibly due to the lack of roads.</p>
