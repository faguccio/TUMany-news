        <h2>Raising Electric Vehicle Awareness</h2>
        <p>One of the significant barriers to widespread electric vehicle adoption is a lack of awareness. Campaigns like the <strong>#EVAwareness</strong> initiative are working to educate the public on the benefits of electric vehicles (EVs). These campaigns aim to dispel myths about EV range anxiety and charging infrastructure, encouraging more consumers to make the switch.</p>
