    <article>
        <p>In a world rapidly moving towards electric vehicles, traditional automotive components like engine knock sensors, drum brakes, and transmission systems are undergoing significant innovations to remain relevant. This article explores how these parts are adapting to meet modern standards and expectations, with a focus on road safety and performance enhancement.</p>
        
        <h2>Engine Knock Sensors: The Silent Guardians</h2>
        <p>Engine knock sensors, often overlooked, play a crucial role in vehicle performance and longevity. Recent advancements have improved their sensitivity and reliability, helping to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce harmful emissions. As combustion engines face stiffer competition from electric drivetrains, these sensors are more critical than ever in maximizing the efficiency of internal combustion engines.</p>
        
        <h2>Drum Brakes: An Old Classic with a New Purpose</h2>
        <p>Drum brakes, once considered outdated, are experiencing a renaissance in certain segments of the automotive industry. Thanks to new materials and designs, they offer improved stopping power and durability. These enhancements are particularly beneficial in off-road and commercial vehicles, where robustness is a priority.</p>
        
        <h2>Underbody Protection: Safety First</h2>
        <p>With road safety a growing concern, underbody protection has become a focal point in vehicle design. New composite materials and aerodynamic designs are being employed to safeguard critical components without sacrificing fuel efficiency. This is particularly vital in regions with harsh weather conditions or rough terrain.</p>
        
        <h2>Transmission Systems: Shifting Towards Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Modern transmission systems are evolving to offer smoother shifts and better fuel economy. Innovative technologies such as continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) and dual-clutch systems are now more refined, providing drivers with enhanced control and comfort.</p>
        
        <h2>Lug Wrenches: Simplifying Maintenance</h2>
        <p>The humble lug wrench is also seeing improvements, with ergonomic designs and lighter materials making tire changes easier and quicker. This is an essential development for drivers who prefer DIY maintenance or find themselves in emergency situations.</p>
        
        <h2>Auto Parts and Road Safety: A Combined Effort</h2>
        <p>Automotive manufacturers are increasingly focusing on integrating road safety features into traditional components. From enhanced visibility in brake lights to improved material resilience in critical parts, the goal is to create safer driving environments without compromising performance.</p>
