    <div class="content">
        <p>The automotive industry is on the cusp of a technological revolution, with manufacturers striving to integrate cutting-edge features that enhance safety and convenience. While electric vehicles dominate the headlines, it's crucial to explore other advancements that are transforming how we drive. From <span class="highlight">lane assist</span> systems to smart <span class="highlight">headlights</span> and robust <span class="highlight">CV joints</span>, these innovations are setting new standards in automotive safety.</p>

        <h2>Lane Assist: Keeping Drivers on the Right Path</h2>
        <p>Modern vehicles are increasingly equipped with <strong>lane assist technology</strong>, which uses cameras and sensors to monitor the vehicle's position within its lane. If the system detects any unintended lane departure, it alerts the driver and can even provide gentle steering inputs to keep the car centered. This feature significantly reduces the risk of accidents caused by driver distraction or drowsiness.</p>

        <h2>Adaptive Headlights: Lighting the Way Forward</h2>
        <p>Gone are the days of static headlights. <strong>Adaptive headlights</strong> are now the norm, with their ability to adjust the beam's direction based on steering input and vehicle speed. This smart lighting system enhances visibility around curves and corners, ensuring a safer drive in low-light conditions. Furthermore, these headlights can automatically dim to prevent blinding oncoming traffic, improving safety for all road users.</p>

        <h2>CV Joints: Ensuring Smooth and Reliable Drivetrain Performance</h2>
        <p>The <strong>CV joint</strong> (Constant Velocity joint) is a crucial component in front-wheel and all-wheel drive vehicles, allowing the drive shaft to transmit power efficiently at various angles. Recent advancements have focused on enhancing durability and reducing maintenance needs, ensuring that vehicles maintain optimal performance under different driving conditions.</p>

        <h2>Advanced Defrosters: A Clear View in All Seasons</h2>
        <p>Winter driving presents unique challenges, but modern <strong>defroster systems</strong> have evolved to provide quicker and more effective solutions. These systems use advanced technology to rapidly clear frost and fog from windshields, enhancing visibility and safety during harsh weather conditions.</p>

        <p>As these technologies become more sophisticated, they are gradually bridging the gap between traditional vehicles and the futuristic vision of fully autonomous driving. Automakers are investing heavily in research and development to bring these features to market, ensuring that safety and convenience remain at the forefront of their offerings.</p>
