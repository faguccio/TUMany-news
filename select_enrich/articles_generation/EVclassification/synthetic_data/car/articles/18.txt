            <h2>Understanding Engine Knock and Its Implications</h2>
            <p>Another key focus for car enthusiasts and mechanics alike is the phenomenon of <span class="highlight">engine knock</span>. This occurs when the air-fuel mixture in an engine's cylinder ignites prematurely, causing a knocking or pinging sound. While often overlooked, engine knock can lead to significant engine damage if not addressed promptly.</p>
            <p>Modern vehicles are increasingly equipped with sensors that detect engine knock, adjusting the ignition timing to mitigate its effects. This proactive approach not only enhances the lifespan of the engine but also improves overall vehicle performance.</p>
