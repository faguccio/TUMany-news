        <h2>The Carbon Footprint of Automotive Components</h2>
        <p>While electric vehicles (EVs) have become a central focus in reducing automotive carbon footprints, there's more to sustainability than just transitioning to electric. Traditional vehicles still dominate the roads, and manufacturers are innovating to make every component more eco-friendly.</p>
        <p>One of the often-overlooked areas is the carbon footprint associated with vehicle maintenance parts like <span class="highlight">spark plugs</span> and <span class="highlight">fuel filters</span>. Advances in materials science are enabling the creation of these components with reduced environmental impact, both in terms of production and longevity.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Innovations in Automotive Interiors</h2>
        <p>The interior of a vehicle, particularly the <span class="highlight">roof liner</span>, has traditionally relied on materials that are not environmentally friendly. However, companies are now experimenting with recycled and biodegradable materials to ensure that every part of a vehicle contributes to a greener planet.</p>
        <p>These materials not only help in reducing the overall carbon footprint but also enhance the vehicle's appeal by offering innovative design options that cater to environmentally conscious consumers.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Driver Assistance and Fuel Efficiency</h2>
        <p>In the realm of <span class="highlight">driver assistance</span>, technology plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability. Modern systems can optimize fuel consumption by suggesting more efficient driving routes and providing real-time feedback to drivers about their driving habits.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, these systems are integrated with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, helping them achieve near-EV levels of efficiency. By ensuring that drivers operate their vehicles as efficiently as possible, these systems contribute significantly to reducing the environmental impact of transportation.</p>
    </section>

    <footer>
        <p>As the automotive industry continues to evolve, it is clear that sustainability extends beyond just electric vehicles. Through innovations in component materials, interior design, and driver assistance technology, the path to a greener future is being paved in unexpected and exciting ways.</p>
