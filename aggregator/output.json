Indeed, as our own Conor Knell discovered during a test drive, the abrupt plunge from 70 to a 50 mph restriction is a reliable giveaway of who’s local and who’s not.</p>, <p>Newcomers, he found, slam on their brakes in anticipation of imminent speed cameras while regulars steam on by, treating the legal limits as mere guidelines. It seems worlds away from Coventry's rigorous streets where a host of average speed cameras rigorously enforce motoring discipline.</p>, <p>Coventry motorists opened up about their experiences, with Conan the Mermaid reflecting: \"All the cars that I have driven in my 70+ years show the speed to be approximately 10% greater than the actual. This means when you think you are doing 50, you're doing only 45. Thus the glares from the impatient others. Hope this helps.\"</p>, <p><b>READ MORE: <a>Tribute to 'devoted' dad in Coventry's death and funeral notices this week</a></b></p>, <p>PERCY adds: \"Yep driven down there and all cars pass me. We need average speed cameras on as many roads as possible. The difference is noticeable straight away, .and all you who hate them, carry on speeding, pay your fine then we'll get more cameras, win win.\"</p>, <p>Mxlerone writes: \"What's weird is that when they were building the new tollbar roundabout and flyover, that 50mph section had average speed cameras put in place and everything worked fine (or you received a fine). For some reason it must have been decided to allow the road to descend into anarchy through their removal instead.\"</p>, <p>Kenpas says: \"The reason the speed limit is 50mph on that part of the A46/A45, is the bend under the Toll Bar junction, as speeding vehicles are in danger of overturning under the junction. Also there is parking places built along that stretch for the mobile speed cameras to park up. I haven't seen any mobile cameras on it yet!!\"</p>, <p>Disorganised1 adds: \"Just drive around the ring road. I get overtaken daily driving at the speed limit, and on both sides of the car - often by private hire cars.\"</p>, <p>Mikehf comments: \"Never have any problem sticking to the speed limit.\"</p>, <p>Destroyedcountry believes: \"Oh dear, anyone with a inch of common sense would never have set the speed limits as they are!\"</p>, <p>Over on our <a>Facebook page</a> - Belle Barnes says: \"Excellent point and I don’t know why it’s not been called out before. I regularly drive on that road and I too follow the speed limit signs. They are there for a reason so when you feel like your the one in the wrong, the truth is that everyone else driving at 60/70 mph are in the wrong. I agree, it’s an accident waiting to happen. Maybe this article will make the highways agency or whoever deals with our roads, sort it out once and for all.\"</p>, <p>While Saucey Sue adds: \"The 50mph stretch is round by the jaguar and A444/<a>Warwick</a> bypass where there are multiple lanes for different places, similar to the picture of the article above, as well as slip roads joining. It’s by far safer to reduce the speed limit than having everyone trying to achieve national speed limit whilst also trying to be in the correct lane. I guarantee there’d be people screaming about the number of accidents if the speed limit was 70. And remember people, a speed limit is not a target, it’s a maximum speed allowed.\"</p>, <p>Vicki Walls-Gilbert thinks: \"Well if you’re driving to the letter of the law you’ll be in the left hand lane and not be holding up anyone who wishes to speed as you’ll pull over as soon as you’ve over taken. Which leaves a lane free for the speedsters! You will also not travel in the right hand lane for miles, not over taking anything, often travelling way below the speed limit simply because you haven’t got the balls to change into the right hand lane as you approach your junction to turn right.\"</p>, <p><b>So do you believe that the limit is correct?

        "html": "[<h2>Support the Guardian</h2>, <h1>Electric shock: carmakers battle strict UK electric car rules as big fines loom</h1>, <p>As Ford announced cutting 800 UK jobs it said rules forcing companies to sell more EVs each year are ‘unworkable’ </p>, <p><span>W</span>hen Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the <a>zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate</a>, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.</p>, <p>Someone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker <a>strongly backed the policy</a>. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.</p>, <p>“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”</p>, <p>The carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the <a>Fast Charge newsletter</a>. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.</p>, <p>During the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit <a>amid problems in getting parts</a>). That has changed now. Carmakers are <a>not experiencing the expected demand</a> for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.</p>, <p>Demand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over <a>public charger numbers</a>, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if <a>much cheaper in the long run</a>) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.</p>, <p>The carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.</p>, <p>Under the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.</p>, <p>The mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter <a>Tom Allen</a>.</p>, <p>For the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.</p>, <p>The Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the <a>Vauxhall</a>, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could <a>close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton</a> because of the mandate.</p>, <p>Yet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.</p>, <p>Vicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.</p>, <p>“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”</p>, <p>Sign up to <span>Business Today</span></p>, <p>Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning</p>, <p>after newsletter promotion</p>, <p>It is tricky to work out how much pressure individual carmakers are actually under. The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).</p>, <p>With all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the <a>18.1% electric sales</a> achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.</p>, <p>Ben Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.</p>, <p>Carmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.</p>, <p>The business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.</p>, <p>Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.</p>, <p>“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.</p>, <p>Whatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.</p>, <p>David Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”</p>, <h2>Most viewed</h2>, <h2>Most viewed</h2>]"

        "html": "[<h1>\n\t\t\t\tEU battery hopes in tatters as Northvolt CEO resigns and company files for bankruptcy\t\t\t</h1>, <p>\n\t\t\t\tThe company ran into big problems with production at a time when demand for EVs slumped. \t\t\t</p>, <p>In a huge blow to Europe's plan to set up its own battery industry to power electric cars, Peter Carlsson resigned as CEO of battery-maker Northvolt on Friday morning, shortly after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S.</p>, <p>\"The <a>Chapter 11 filing</a> allows a period during which the company can be reorganized, ramp up operations while honoring customer and supplier commitments, and ultimately position itself for the long-term,\" Carlsson, a former Tesla executive who cofounded Northvolt in 2016, <a>said in a statement</a>.</p>, <p>He will stay on as a senior adviser and remain on the board.</p>, <p>The filing, and departure of its cofounder, marks a swift reversal of fortunes for the company that was set to be Europe's battery champion and chief competitor to the Chinese and other Asian companies that dominate the sector.</p>, <p>“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition.</p>, <p>Northvolt's Swedish subsidiary, Northvolt Ett Expansion, <a>filed an application for bankruptcy </a>in October.</p>, <p>Sweden's government has consistently said it will not step in to save the company. German officials considered <a>getting involved</a>, but the government is cash-strapped and dealing with turmoil in its domestic automotive industry — the same woes that started Northvolt's downfall.</p>, <p>Chinese automaker insiders, meanwhile, are scratching their heads at European leaders' willingness to let Northvolt die, said Cornel Ban, an associate professor at the Copenhagen Business School, who studies electric vehicle investments in China.</p>, <p>“[Northvolt] is our silver bullet in the competition,” he said.</p>, <p>The company managed to create an EV battery without lithium or other critical raw materials that China controls. However, it ran into large problems with overspending, management and production. It was also hit with an unexpected slowdown in EV demand.</p>, <p>\"Why didn't we solve the financing sooner? It was an incredibly complicated game to get bridging financing between different stakeholders. We finally had to give up on that attempt,\" Carlsson <a>told reporters</a>.</p>, <p>He blamed the company's difficulties on starting new production facilities with innovative technology. \"When you start with new products, build a new factory, and hire new employees, you're taking on a significant challenge,\" he said.</p>, <p>While the Chapter 11 filing will allow it to restructure, Northvolt's meteoric rise is over as it struggles to bring in new financing.</p>, <p>Tom Johnstone, the interim chair of Northvolt’s board, said: “This decisive step will allow Northvolt to continue its mission to establish a homegrown, European industrial base for battery production.” </p>, <p>In a remark to reporters, Carlsson said the company needs to raise between $1 billion and $1.2 billion to get the company back on track. By filing for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., it now has access to $145 million in cash collateral and $100 million in new financing from one of its existing customers, the <a>company said</a>.</p>, <p>\"First and foremost, this was necessary to capitalize and drive the company forward,\" Carlsson said. \"Essentially, Northvolt is crucial for both our customers and for Europe's green transition. The recapitalization allows us to emerge from this process with a simpler capital structure.\"</p>, <p>Northvolt's downward spiral began over the summer when BMW canceled a contract worth €2 billion. The next blows came fast, with Volvo saying it would take over its joint venture with Northvolt as soon as it finds an investment partner.</p>, <p>In September, Northvolt <a>announced</a> it was laying off 1,600 people, or a quarter of its workforce in Sweden, and suspending its gigafactory expansion project.</p>, <p>But the biggest setback came from Volkswagen, which is Northvolt's top investor and holds 21 percent of the company. The German automaker is facing <a>a financial crisis</a> of its own with slowing sales in China and negotiations with union workers over layoffs and potential plant closures.</p>, <p>Despite the Chapter 11 filing, the company's flagship gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden, and Northvolt Labs in Västerås, Sweden, will remain operational. Northvolt Germany and Northvolt North America will also continue operating, with the company saying that a C$7 billion factory being planned for Quebec is still on track.</p>, <p>\"There are many questions about the speed of the green transition and Europe's role. It's essential to keep pushing forward,\" Carlsson said. \"We'll regret it in 20 years if we don't accelerate the transition and create a strong European market with strong European champions.\"</p>, <h2>\n<span>\n<svg><path></path></svg>\n</span>\n<span>\n\t\t\t\tOur readers read next\t\t\t</span>\n</h2>, <h2>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope’s economy took another downward lurch in November, survey shows\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h2>, <h2>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLast year, the world pledged to move away from fossil fuels.

        "html": "[<p>Search</p>, <p>Menu</p>, <h1>Kia EV6 GT gets even more power plus trick gearbox from Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</h1>, <h2>Already Kia’s most powerful car, the EV6 GT will now produce up to 641bhp and 770Nm of torque</h2>, <p>The <a>Kia EV6 GT</a> is about to receive even more power – and will also get one of the more novel features from the closely related <a>Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</a>.</p>, <p>Already the most powerful car in Kia’s line-up, the <a>EV6</a> GT currently produces 577bhp and 740Nm of <a>torque</a> from its dual-motor powertrain. However, as part of a mid-life refresh, the maximum power output has jumped to 641bhp and 770Nm of torque when ‘GT’ mode is activated. During everyday driving, there will be 601bhp on tap, and the same 740Nm as before. </p>, <p>Accordingly, performance is likely to be improved. 0-62mph takes just 3.5 seconds in the outgoing EV6 GT, and while Kia has not yet confirmed a figure for the upgraded model, we expect that extra power will have shaved at least a tenth of a second off the already impressive sprint time. </p>, <p>That would enable it to at least match the <a>Hyundai</a> Ioniq 5 N’s 3.4-second 0-62mph sprint, and come close to the <a>Tesla Model 3 Performance</a>’s time of roughly three seconds.</p>, <p>The only other detail Kia has confirmed so far is that the EV6 GT will get a new ‘Virtual Gear Shift’ feature, just like the Ioniq 5 N. It’s designed to create a more engaging driving experience by adjusting the car’s torque output to deliver a small jolt and create the impression of a gear change when you pull on the paddles on the steering wheel. </p>, <p>A synthesised internal combustion engine soundtrack is also pumped into the cabin, which changes as the ‘revs’ climb and the driver shifts. If that doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, in the Ioniq 5 N, both the noises and faux gear changes can be switched off for a more conventional electric car driving experience. </p>, <p>However, Auto Express was told earlier this year that the EV6 GT will not get the Ioniq 5 N’s uprated, stiffer suspension competents, so it’s likely to remain the slightly softer choice of the two. </p>, <p>The EV6 GT will benefit from a new 84kWh battery as well, as every version of the regular <a>Kia</a> EV6 sold in the UK uses this powerpack, which should provide a boost to the outgoing model’s 263-mile range. </p>, <p>Styling and interior changes will mirror those that the regular EV6 received earlier this year, including the new ‘Star Map’ daytime running light design and a revised front end inspired by the flagship <a>Kia EV9</a>. The cabin benefited from a new three-spoke steering wheel, and the firm’s latest infotainment software, which added wireless <a>Android Auto</a> and <a>Apple CarPlay</a>.</p>, <p>The first official images and more details of the new <a>Kia EV6</a> GT are expected to be released before the end of the year, with the model set to hit the road in 2025.</p>, <p><em><strong>Click here for a list of the </strong></em><a><em><strong>fastest SUVs in the world</strong></em></a><em><strong>...</strong></em></p>, <p>As our news reporter, Ellis is responsible for covering everything new and exciting in the motoring world, from quirky quadricycles to luxury MPVs.

        "html": "[<h2>Support the Guardian</h2>, <h1>Elon Musk has cozied into Trump’s White House. How long will this bromance last?</h1>, <p>The absurd Musk-Trump pact might have a silver lining: their relationship, like Trump’s coalition at large, is fragile</p>, <p><span>I</span>t’s deja vu all over again, again. In the wake of Donald Trump’s decisive re-election, his transition team has moved to pack his cabinet and adviser positions with figures straight out of the <a>Star Wars</a> cantina – some of the most dangerous and bizarre sideshows from every corner of his chaotic galaxy.</p>, <p>In the Trump Cinematic Universe, loyalty usurps qualification. That’s why <a>Pete Hegseth</a>, a Fox News host who wants to eliminate “woke” officials from the military, got tapped to oversee our national defense. And it’s why <a>Matt Gaetz</a> was asked to helm the very Department of Justice that was investigating him for alleged sex trafficking, before his abrupt withdrawal from consideration.</p>, <p>But perhaps no figure better captures the cartoonish nature of Trump’s staffing philosophy than Elon Musk, the literal <a>richest man on Earth</a>, who has somehow grabbed the wheel of a presidential transition that’s navigating the road ahead about as well as one of his <a>Teslas</a>.</p>, <p>From offering his <a>two cents</a> on presidential appointments, to joining <a>calls with the Ukrainian president</a>, to adjudicating the race for Senate majority leader via an <a>X poll</a>, the man who broke Twitter now has his sights set on breaking the federal government. He’s poised to hack the budget, ramrod in his half-baked policy musings and push through deregulation that will inevitably benefit his fleet of companies.</p>, <p>Like any great romcom, Musk and Trump got off to a rocky start. Two years ago, before he donned a <a>“dark gothic Maga” cap</a> himself, Musk was urging Trump <a>to “hang up his hat</a>”, and Trump was calling Musk too chicken to buy Twitter. But then Musk did buy Twitter, and began diligently turning it into <a>a bastion</a> of rightwing misinformation called X.</p>, <p>The arc of this entanglement reached its inevitable conclusion when Musk <a>rewired the platform’s algorithm</a> to promote his own conspiracies about <a>immigrants</a> and <a>election interference</a>, while also giving free advertisement to Trump to the tune of <a>2bn views</a>. Though Trump was already the first major party nominee <a>to own a social media platform</a> in Truth Social, he now essentially leases a second one for free.</p>, <p>While Trump received support from Musk gratis, his voters received million-dollar checks. For all Musk’s <a>handwringing</a> about “ballot harvesting”, he engaged in a brazen election interference scheme when he more or less <a>paid citizens</a> to vote for Trump.</p>, <p>Musks’s so-called sweepstakes, which a Pennsylvania court <a>waved through</a>, culminates big money’s political playbook. Billionaires no longer need to launder their bribes through Super Pacs with vaguely patriotic names. They can avoid that rigmarole, cut out the middleman and offer direct financial incentives for supporting whichever candidate they deem most favorable to their business interests.</p>, <p>And now that Musk’s doubtfully legal efforts have paid off in the election of the country’s <a>first president</a> with a felony conviction, the true singularity can begin – not the merging of humans with AI <a>supposedly portended</a> by Neuralink, but of Musk’s agenda with Trump’s. There’s no shortage of “<a>catastrophic conflicts of interest</a>”, to quote former chief of government ethics Walter Shaub. Sure enough, Musk’s corporate empire has <a>received $15bn in public contracts</a>, while facing 20 federal investigations. But it would be no more than coincidence should that first number skyrocket and the second number plummet over the next four years.</p>, <p>More troubling than his informal heft as Trump’s self-proclaimed <a>“first buddy”</a>, though, is Musk’s appointment to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency – which, as many have pointed out, somehow <a>takes two people to lead</a>. This glorified taskforce has a mandate to slash government costs, regulations and employment. With his typical spunk, Musk has pledged to eliminate <a>a third of the $6.75tn federal budget</a>, not unlike how he <a>cut half</a> of Twitter’s workforce.</p>, <p>Fortunately for Musk, that austerity doesn’t extend to his own bank account, which has received a generous Trump bump. Post-election Tesla stock surges have already <a>earned him</a> $70bn, and Musk’s appointment may also qualify him to receive a <a>massive tax break</a>. That seems only appropriate given that this faux department’s name abbreviates to Doge, a cryptocurrency that Musk <a>owns “a bunch of”</a>.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, the patent absurdity of the Musk-Trump pact just might offer a silver lining for Democrats. First, <a>analysts</a> and <a>casual observers</a> alike remain skeptical of how long the honeymoon can last between two narcissists whose power is <a>exceeded only</a> by <a>their pettiness</a>. Their relationship, like Trump’s coalition at large, is perilous and fragile.</p>, <p>Second, Doge’s recommendations are just that: nonbinding. Trump himself has described Musk and Ramaswamy as <a>offering</a> “advice and guidance from outside of government”.

        "html": "[<h2>Support the Guardian</h2>, <h1>Northvolt CEO resigns after EV battery maker files for bankruptcy protection</h1>, <p>Peter Carlsson says $1bn to $1.2bn needed to restore business touted as potential European rival to Asian firms</p>, <p>The chief executive of Northvolt has resigned, after the Swedish battery startup filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.</p>, <p>Peter Carlsson, who has led Northvolt since 2016, will step aside with immediate effect, the company said on Friday. Carlsson said Northvolt, which is widely seen as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry, needs to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn in order to restore the business.</p>, <p>Northvolt has built a factory in northern <a>Sweden</a> where it hopes to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year. It was the most prominent of a host of European startups hoping to challenge the dominant Asian battery industry.</p>, <p>However, <a>the company has tipped into crisis</a> in recent months as cash ran dry and it experienced problems getting its first factory up and running properly.</p>, <p>Northvolt on Thursday announced it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US after talks over rescue investments failed. It said it had enough cash to support operations for only about a week and it had secured $100m (£80m) in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations would continue as normal during the bankruptcy.</p>, <p>“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in a bankruptcy court in Houston. Northvolt, which has operations in California, has about $30m in cash and about $5.8bn of debts.</p>, <p>The company, which employs about 6,600 staff across seven countries, expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.</p>, <p>In September, Northvolt <a>said it would cut 1,600 jobs</a> in response to “headwinds” <a>blowing through the EV industry</a>. It has also faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time, in Sweden, Germany and the US.</p>, <p>Within months, Northvolt has gone from a much-heralded startup to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, and hobbled by production problems, the loss of BMW as an anchor customer and a lack of funding.</p>, <p>Europe has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce western carmakers’ reliance on Asian rivals, which built their dominant position out of decades of experience in making batteries for consumer electronics. Industry leaders include China’s CATL and the EV and battery maker BYD, Japan’s Panasonic and South Korea’s LG.</p>, <p>Northvolt said the $100m was part of $245m in financing support for the bankruptcy. The Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer, has said it will loan $100m to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of EV battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.</p>, <p>Carlsson, who will remain as a “senior adviser” and a member of the board, said the company had been “like a baby” to him, but that it had struggled to ramp up production.</p>, <p>“In hindsight, we were overambitious on the timing in which we could achieve it,” he added.</p>, <p>The investment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.</p>, <p>But EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.</p>, <p>The Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, said on X that the government continued to support the EV battery industry and hoped the restructuring would help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes.</p>, <h2><span>More on this story</span></h2>, <h2><span>More on this story</span></h2>, <h3><span>Don’t waver on electric car targets, big UK businesses tell Labour</span></h3>, <h3><span>Bentley delays its switch to electric-only cars from 2030 to 2035</span></h3>, <h3><span>Electric car sales grow in UK despite decline in overall vehicle market</span></h3>, <h3><span>Volvo Cars to buy out Northvolt from jointly owned gigafactory in Sweden</span></h3>, <h3><span>Project to build German EV microchip factory put on hold</span></h3>, <h3><span>Vauxhall owner to make decision on future of UK plants ‘in next few weeks’</span></h3>, <h3><span>‘Huge losses’: Sweden fears for future of batterymaker Northvolt</span></h3>, <h3><span>Car industry calls for shift in EU emissions targets amid slowing EV sales</span></h3>, <h3><span>Norway: electric cars outnumber petrol for first time in ‘historic milestone’</span></h3>, <h2>Most viewed</h2>, <h2>Most viewed</h2>]"

Chapter 11 provides the company with the financing to focus on operational improvements and supporting customers, while allowing for restructuring, reorganization, and fundraising to secure a long-term competitive positioning. The company is also announcing that Peter Carlsson will take on a role as Senior Advisor and step aside from his role as CEO. He also remains a Member of the Board.</p>, <p>Peter Carlsson has led Northvolt since its inception in 2016. He co-founded Northvolt with the mission to drive sustainable energy solutions through the creation of a pioneer in European battery production. Northvolt Ett is the first truly European battery gigafactory delivering to customers at large scale. Northvolt Labs is the epicenter of European battery research and development, achieving technical breakthroughs and leading in patent creation. In parallel, Northvolt is building groundbreaking facilities in Heide, Germany and Montreal, Canada, catering for a completely new industry in the Western economies.</p>, <p>Peter Carlsson commented: “Today marks a significant new phase for Northvolt as well as for me personally. The Chapter 11 filing allows a period during which the company can be reorganized, ramp up operations while honoring customer and supplier commitments, and ultimately position itself for the long-term. That makes it a good time for me to hand over to the next generation of leaders.\"</p>, <p>Northvolt’s Interim Chairman of the Board of Directors, Tom Johnstone, commented: “We are incredibly thankful to Peter for his vision and dedication to building Northvolt from an unprecedented idea to becoming Europe’s battery manufacturing champion. Peter’s perspective will continue to benefit Northvolt, as a Senior Advisor and Member of the Board, while the new leadership will steer the company into the next stage.”</p>, <p>The company leadership will consist of Pia Aaltonen-Forsell, Chief Financial Officer, and Matthias Arleth, the President of Cells, who will now take the role of Chief Operations Officer. Together, and supported by Scott Millar as Chief Restructuring Officer, they will jointly lead Northvolt. The search process for a new CEO has been initiated.</p>, <p>Tom Johnstone, added: “I am very pleased that the two recent additions to Northvolt’s leadership will jointly lead this next phase of operational improvement, increased customer focus, and financial restructuring.”</p>, <p>This transition underscores Northvolt’s commitment to adapting to an evolving market, with the new leadership focused on advancing the company’s goals of sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and continued innovation.
