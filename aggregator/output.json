José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, examines the best sellers with Autovista24 editor Tom Geggus.</em></p>, <p>Breaking down <a>EV</a> sales by brands in China, BYD claimed a market share of 31.4% between January and July. This was an increase of 0.6 percentage points (pp) from the first seven months of 2024. In a distant second, Tesla lost its grip on the market slightly. Its share fell by 0.3pp to 6.5%.</p>, <p></p>, <p>Li Auto was the third biggest brand in terms of market share between January and July. Enjoying the success of its L6 model, the carmaker gained 0.1pp to represent 4.7% of EV sales in China. Wuling followed closely behind with a 4.7% hold on the market. This was up 0.1pp from the first six months of the year.</p>, <p>Finishing fifth, Aito represented 4.4% of all plug-in model sales in the country. In sixth place, Geely benefitted from the progress of its Galaxy L6 and L7 models as its market share climbed by 0.1pp to 4%.</p>, <h2><strong>BYD led by namesake brand</strong></h2>, <p>With brands and alliances gathered into OEM groups, BYD continued to lead the market between January and July. The manufacturer accounted for over a third (33.4%) of sales in the region in the first seven months of the year. This success can be attributed to the strong performance of its namesake brand.</p>, <p>However, other brands in the giant’s stable appeared to struggle. Denza, Fang Cheng Bao, and Yangwang encountered difficulties and were unable to help boost the OEM’s margins. Even so, BYD’s control over the Chinese EV market looks assured.</p>, <p></p>, <p>Geely–Volvo was a distant runner-up with a 7.8% share, down by 0.1pp since June’s report. This followed a slow month for some of the OEM’s brands, such as Zeekr.</p>, <h2><strong>SAIC’s share falls</strong></h2>, <p>In third place, single-brand Tesla saw its hold on the market drop by 0.3pp to 6.5%. However, Tesla maintained its top-three position as SAIC’s share fell even further, by 0.5pp to 6.5%. SAIC’s market position appeared fragile with its foreign partners, GM and VW, in trouble. The group seems reliant on its own brands to stay afloat in the overall market.</p>, <p>For example, MG saw sales drop by 49% and Maxus was down by 44%. SAIC’s new premium brand, IM Motors, did record 6,000 deliveries in July. While this was a year-on-year increase of 249%, it barely improved the group’s figures.</p>, <p>Taking joint fourth in the OEM table, Changan saw its share shrink by 0.2pp to 6.2%. However, with SAIC struggling, the Chongqing-based company can be expected to climb up to fourth place in the coming months.</p>, <p>Want to know which models took the Chinese EV market by storm in July and the first seven months of the year?

José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, reviews the results with Autovista24 journalist Tom Hooker.</em></p>, <p>Tesla took the <a>best-selling EV title in July</a> with its <a>Model Y</a>, remaining the most popular plug-in brand so far this year. It held a market share of 10.8% in the first seven months of the year. However, this was 0.6 percentage points (pp) down from the previous month’s report.</p>, <p></p>, <p>This drop was to be expected, as the carmaker usually experiences a slump in the first month of every quarter. However, it appears that Tesla’s dominance is now not as clear-cut as in previous years.</p>, <p>Tesla is still expected to be Europe’s best-selling <a>EV</a> brand in 2024. Yet, it will likely have a greater challenge retaining this title in 2025.</p>, <h2><strong>A boost for BMW</strong></h2>, <p>On the other hand, BMW gained ground in July. The <a>manufacturer</a> accounted for 10.1% of plug-in <a>registrations</a> in the year to date, up from 9.9% in June. This performance should be enough to guarantee a second-place finish in 2024, making for the third year in a row.</p>, <p>BMW now has a 1.3pp lead over German rival Mercedes-Benz. The latter was stable in July, taking third with a market share of 8.8%.</p>, <p>Volvo stayed steady in fourth, accounting for 8.6% of EV deliveries in <a>Europe</a> during the first seven months of 2024. Although the <a>EX30</a> is gaining share for the Swedish marque, the recent poor performance of the EX40 and its plug-in hybrid version, the Volvo XC40 Recharge, has hampered overall figures.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, fifth-placed Volkswagen (VW) gained 0.2pp in July, capturing 6.7% of the market. It distanced itself from Audi in sixth, which posted a 6.5% share, stable from June.</p>, <p>VW has appeared in the European EV top three almost every year since 2015, with the only exception being 2019. This means the carmaker will be pushing to overtake Volvo and Mercedes-Benz before the end of 2024.</p>, <p>Kia was some distance behind in seventh, making up 4.6% of plug-in registrations during the first seven months of the year. It gained 0.1pp from the previous month, creating a gap between itself and Peugeot in eighth. The French manufacturer went from a 4.5% market hold in June to a 4.6% share in July.</p>, <h2><strong>VW keeps comfortable EV lead</strong></h2>, <p>Grouping brands under their respective parent companies, VW Group kept a comfortable lead as the best-selling plug-in OEM. It benefitted from good performances across its EV lineup, with its share rising 0.2pp to 20.4%.</p>, <p>Almost 10pp behind came Stellantis in second, accounting for 10.9% of plug-in deliveries. Despite this being a 0.3pp fall from June, the group overtook Tesla. However, it is not expected to remain in this position for long.</p>, <p></p>, <p>In third, BMW Group sat level with Stellantis after gaining 0.2pp from the previous month. The OEM is relying on the success of its <a>iX1</a>, <a>i4</a> and <a>i5</a> models to gain further share and push for second place.</p>, <p>Tesla dropped two positions in July, falling to fourth place. It captured 10.8% of the European EV market, but it is expected to regain ground in August and September.</p>, <p>Elsewhere, Geely-Volvo was stable in fifth position with a 10.6% market share. Mercedes-Benz Group was some distance behind in sixth, making up 9.1% of EV registrations from January to July. Lastly, Hyundai Motor Group gained ground in eighth, increasing by 0.2pp to a 7.9% market share in July.</p>, <p>Share this article</p>, <h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>, <h5><span>European EV registrations fall in July with Tesla on top</span></h5>, <p>23 September 2024</p>, <h5><span>Concern for EU new-car market as emissions targets loom</span></h5>, <p>25 September 2024</p>, <h5><span>How to recharge Europe’s battery-electric vehicle market</span></h5>, <p>06 June 2024</p>, <h5><span>Which car brands sold the most EVs in July?</span></h5>, <p>18 September 2024</p>, <p>Top</p>, <p>Autovista24 © 2024</p>]"

José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, explores the leading brands and carmakers with Autovista24 editor Tom Geggus.</em></p>, <p>The brand leading <a>China’s</a> <a>EV</a> market in the first eight months of 2024 remained consistent. Accounting for 32.3% of all battery-electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) sales, BYD held a firm grip on first place.</p>, <p>Its share has surged 0.9 percentage points (pp) from <a>July’s report</a>. It is highly unlikely that this domination will end anytime soon, with a 25.9pp advantage over the second-place brand.</p>, <p></p>, <p>There was some change for the brands following in BYD’s wake. Tesla saw its share drop to 6.4% from 6.5% in the first seven months of the year.</p>, <p>It is worth remembering that Tesla only sells BEVs, while BYD also delivers PHEVs such as the Seal U DM-i. This makes the brand more accessible for buyers not yet ready to go all electric.</p>, <p>In third, Wuling benefitted from the positive performance of its Bingo and Mini EV models. This saw its market share reach 5.1%, up by 0.5 percentage points (pp) from <a>July’s report</a>.</p>, <p>This meant it surpassed Li Auto, which remained consistent, holding a market share of 4.7%. This consistency was thanks to the result of the ongoing popularity of its L6 model.</p>, <p>In fifth, Geely’s Galaxy E5 and Panda Mini models shined in August, pushing its share up by 0.2pp to 4.2%. This meant it overtook Aito, which saw its grip on the market falter, dropping to sixth place with a 4.1% share. This was down from a 4.4% market hold in July.</p>, <p>Aion claimed seventh with 3.7%, but without a new best-selling model, it cannot be expected to compete for fifth any time soon.</p>, <h2><strong>BYD leads carmaker charts</strong></h2>, <p>By assembling all brands under their parent companies and alliances, BYD continued to comfortably lead the Chinese EV market. In the first eight months of the year, the OEM took a 34% market share, jumping 0.6pp from July. This was predominantly thanks to the strong results of its namesake brand.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, its daughter brands collectively saw a shrinking market share. This means Denza, Fang Cheng Bao, and Yangwang are not helping to boost their larger manufacturing group’s profit margins. For the moment, BYD appears to have its domestic EV market under total control, mirroring Tesla’s success in the <a>US</a>.</p>, <p></p>, <p>Geely-Volvo was a distant runner-up, holding a 7.8% market share between January and August 2024. The positive result of Geely was dragged down by the likes of Zeekr which had a slow August.</p>, <p>Tesla finished third with a 6.4% market share, down from 6.5% in the previous report. Meanwhile, SAIC took fourth, holding on to 6.2% of sales. However, the carmaker’s position in the Chinese EV market looks precarious at present.</p>, <p>It was unable to profit from Wuling’s positive result due to other weak brands. This includes its joint ventures with foreign partners including GM and Volkswagen. August saw both MG and Maxus give underwhelming performances.</p>, <p>Its new premium brand, IM Motors, did increase sales considerably. However, this equated to only 6,100 units, which barely altered SAIC’s performance.</p>, <p>Below in fifth place, Changan saw its share slide slightly to 5.8% from 6.2% in July’s report. However, sixth-place GAC only held a 4.6% share, meaning Changan can feel safe in the top five for a while yet. </p>, <p>Share this article</p>, <h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>, <h5><span>Definitive tariffs on BEVs made in China approved in EU vote</span></h5>, <p>04 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>BYD Seagull sales soar in China’s EV market</span></h5>, <p>03 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>BYD stays ahead of its competitors in Chinese EV market</span></h5>, <p>16 September 2024</p>, <h5><span>Which EVs led the Chinese market in July?</span></h5>, <p>13 September 2024</p>, <p>Top</p>, <p>Autovista24 © 2024</p>]"

But which vehicles followed close behind? José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, examines the data with Autovista24 editor Tom Geggus.</em></p>, <p>Registrations of electric vehicles (EVs) climbed 19% year on year in August. Broken down, battery-electric vehicle (BEV) deliveries were up 6% compared to August 2023, reaching roughly one million units.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, plug-in hybrid (PHEV) sales jumped 51% to approximately half a million models. This illustrates the influence of the <a>Chinese market</a>, where PHEVs and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) are proving popular.</p>, <p>Plug-in vehicles accounted for 22% of all <a>new-car</a> sales in August, with BEVs making up 14% alone. <a>EVs</a> made up 19% of the entire market in the first eight months of 2024, climbing 10 million units. All-electric models made up 12% alone, or 6.3 million units, up 10%.</p>, <h2><strong>Tesla enjoys positive August</strong></h2>, <p>The <a>Tesla Model Y</a> led the global EV market in August, delivering 99,290 units. Meanwhile, in fourth place, the Tesla Model 3 ended the month with some 44,413 registrations. These models can be expected to see more success, with the Sedan set to enjoy a peak at the end of the quarter.</p>, <p></p>, <p>While Tesla managed to take two leading positions in the month, BYD placed 11 models in the top 20. BYD’s battle plan to combat competing brands and powertrains is paying dividends.</p>, <p>Amid the carmaker’s considerable lineup, the BYD Song came second in August with 65,274 deliveries. It was followed by the BYD Seagull in third with 49,714 registrations. Also known as the Dolphin Mini, it could well take third next year when it enters new export markets.</p>, <p>The BYD Qin L finished sixth. It saw deliveries ramp up to 35,957 units in only its third month on the market. It achieved this without disrupting sales of the fifth-place Qin Plus, which recorded 43,258 registrations.</p>, <p>This left space for the new Seal 06 to jump to seventh with 33,316 registrations. The BYD Destroyer 05 did well, finishing in 11<sup>th</sup> thanks to 22,870 sales. This means there were four midsize sedans from the Chinese carmaker in the top 11. This tallies to 135,041 units, equating to peak Model Y performance.</p>, <h2><strong>Not Tesla or BYD</strong></h2>, <p>The best-selling EV not built by Tesla or BYD was the Wuling Mini EV, which surged to ninth with 26,464 units. In 10<sup>th</sup>, the Li Auto L6 will likely be the most popular non-tesla and non-BYD model across 2024.</p>, <p>With 22,323 deliveries, the Wuling Bingo came 12<sup>th</sup>, beating the BYD Dolphin. A similar phenomenon occurred in the full-size category. The Aito M9 finished in 16<sup>th</sup>, overcoming rivals from Li Auto as well as the BYD Han, which came 19<sup>th</sup>. With a refresh on the way, the flagship sedan can be expected to rebound in the final quarter.</p>, <p>Outside of the top 20, Geely drew attention with its recently introduced Galaxy E5. It recorded 12,227 deliveries in its first full month in the market. With so many models and brands, the OEM needs to cement a best-seller in the top 20.</p>, <p>The Galaxy E5 could be that EV. It already boasts specs capable of competing with the BYD Yuan Plus, also known as the Atto 3. It will be available with two LFP battery options, 50kWh or 60 kWh. An impressive drag coefficient means a consumption of 11.9kWh per 100km. Export plans are already drawn up, with the model expected in Norway, Australia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>, <p>Finally, the Volkswagen (VW) ID.3 failed to secure a top 20 position, recording 12,971 registrations. This meant the only model from a European OEM was the VW ID.4 in 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>, <h2><strong>Top two titles</strong></h2>, <p>Between January and August, the Tesla Model Y (725,990 units) and BYD Song (448,493 units) held first and second respectively. Meanwhile, the Tesla Model 3 (321,484 units) gained some ground behind the BYD Qin Plus (327,260 units).</p>, <p></p>, <p>The table appears secure until eighth place, where the BYD Dolphin (137,242 units) surpassed the Aito M7 (133,438 units). The SUV suffered from direct competition from its sibling the Aito M9 (92,929 units), which jumped two places to 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>, <p>Just ahead of it, the GAC Aion S (98,662 units) reached 15<sup>th</sup> with 98662 units. The Li Auto L6 joined the table, in 20<sup>th</sup> with 88,963 deliveries. It can be expected to jump several positions across the remainder of the year.</p>, <p>Currently, there are only four A and B-segment models in the top 20. This is fewer than the five EVs from the E and F segments. This is a strong indication of where the global plug-in market is heading.</p>, <p>Share this article</p>, <h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>, <h5><span>BYD remains on top in China’s EV market</span></h5>, <p>10 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>BYD Seagull sales soar in China’s EV market</span></h5>, <p>03 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>Is Europe’s EV decline impacting market forecasts?</span></h5>, <p>01 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>BMW records growth as Tesla slips in European EV market</span></h5>, <p>30 September 2024</p>, <p>Top</p>, <p>Autovista24 © 2024</p>]"

José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, reviews the brand and OEM performance with Autovisat24 editor Tom Geggus.</em></p>, <p>Deep into its competitive pricing strategy, BYD led the global EV market in August, recording 355,174 registrations. This meant the brand held a market share of 24.2% in the month, far above its competitors.</p>, <p></p>, <p>In second, Tesla continued to see fluctuating sales. Despite the Cybertruck now reaching roughly 4,000 deliveries per month, the performance of other models has dragged the brand downwards. Tesla recorded 152,140 sales globally, claiming 10.4% of the market.</p>, <p>Wuling took third in August, profiting from the positive performance of its Mini EV and Bingo models. It also benefitted from a slow month for legacy OEMs, particularly those based in Europe. With 58,725 units delivered and a 4% market share, the brand beat Li Auto’s 49,883 registrations and 3.4% share.</p>, <p>Geely ended the month in fifth with 421,81 sales and a market share of 2.9%. Most of the brand’s sales came from the Galaxy E5 (12,227 units) and the Panda Mini (11,122).</p>, <p>Leapmotor reached 10<sup>th</sup> place in August with 28,022 registrations and a 1.9% share of the global <a>EV</a> market. With 12 Chinese brands in leading positions, Ford, Peugeot, and Jeep did not make it to the top 20.</p>, <h2><strong>BYD doubles Tesla’s figures</strong></h2>, <p>Between January and August, there was little change at the top of the rankings. In first, BYD recorded twice the number of sales reached by second-place Tesla.</p>, <p>In the first eight months of 2024, the US brand recorded growth in January, May, and July. Meanwhile, February, March, April, June and August saw negative results. But in the first eight months of 2024, Tesla did secure three times as many EV <a>registrations</a> as BMW.</p>, <p></p>, <p>In fourth, Li Auto crept up on the German brand, with only 39,095 units separating the two. This points towards a tight race for third place this year. However, there are more than just two contenders. In fifth place, Wuling was only 43,042 sales behind BMW, although its performance has been inconsistent.</p>, <p>The first position change occurred in eighth, with Geely profiting from its Galaxy E5 model. This allowed it to climb one space while Mercedes-Benz dropped to ninth. Aion also saw rising success, taking 10<sup>th</sup> place and surpassing Volvo.</p>, <p>Taking 15<sup>th</sup>, Hyundai benefitted from yet another bad month for SIAC. Below, Chery profited from a series of new PHEVs in its lineup, climbing one position to 19<sup>th</sup>.</p>, <h2><strong>Price cuts pay off</strong></h2>, <p>With brands gathered under manufacturing groups and alliances, BYD benefitted from its price cuts and new model launches.</p>, <p>The OEM claimed 23.2% of the global EV market in the first eight months of 2024. This was up from 21.8% at the <a>same point last year</a>. Meanwhile, Tesla took an 11% share, down from 14.4% 12 months ago.</p>, <p></p>, <p>Third place went to Geely–Volvo, which stayed steady with a 7.8% share. The OEM saw one of the greatest improvements in the top five. It captured 7.8% of the market in the first eight months of 2024, up from 6.1% at the same time last year.</p>, <p>In fourth, Volkswagen (VW) Group saw its share hit 5.9%, with fifth-place SAIC not far away at 5.2%. Wuling’s positive month compensated for lacklustre results from the rest of the OEM’s lineup.</p>, <p>In sixth, BMW Group lost ground, taking a 3.7% share. This left room for seventh-place Changan to close in, also claiming 3.7% of the global EV market.</p>, <p>With a 3.3% share, Hyundai-Kia took seventh, just ahead of Stellantis. The multinational group needs to see its affordable EVs land soon. This includes the Citroen e-C3 EV, the e-C3 Airscross EV, the Opel Frontera EV, and the Fiat Grande Panda EV.</p>, <h2><strong>Tesla leads BEV table</strong></h2>, <p>Looking solely at battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), Tesla held a leading 17.5% market share in the first eight months of 2024. However, this was down on its 20.6% share recorded at the same point in 2023.</p>, <p></p>, <p>Meanwhile, BYD finished second, claiming 15.9% of the global BEV market. With Tesla losing share, there could be a new leader in the first half of 2025. The reason this is unlikely to happen any sooner is because BY is now focusing its efforts on plug-in hybrids.</p>, <p>Thanks to positive results from its many brands, Geely–Volvo claimed 7.6% of the market, up from 5.6% at the same point last year. Fourth place saw a change with SAIC holding a 7% market share and VW Group a 8.8% share. The BMW Group held a 4.3% share, putting it in sixth, followed by Hyundai–Kia in seventh with 4.2%.</p>, <p></p>, <p>Share this article</p>, <h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>, <h5><span>BYD remains on top in China’s EV market</span></h5>, <p>10 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>BYD Seagull sales soar in China’s EV market</span></h5>, <p>03 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>Is Europe’s EV decline impacting market forecasts?</span></h5>, <p>01 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>BMW records growth as Tesla slips in European EV market</span></h5>, <p>30 September 2024</p>, <p>Top</p>, <p>Autovista24 © 2024</p>]"

Speaking with Autovista24, industry experts gave exclusive insights into the design, <a>technology</a> and ambitions behind their <a>newest vehicles</a>.</p>, <p></p>, <p>Subscribe to the Autovista24 <a>podcast</a> and listen to previous episodes on <a>Spotify</a>, <a>Apple</a> and <a>Amazon Music</a>.</p>, <h2><strong>Show Notes</strong></h2>, <p><a>Highlights from the 2024 Paris Motor Show</a></p>, <p><a>What to look out for at the 2024 Paris Motor Show</a></p>, <h2><strong>French brands fascinate</strong></h2>, <p>One brand with a large presence at the event was Renault, as it revealed the new Renault 4. The highly anticipated B-segment battery-electric vehicle (<a>BEV</a>) takes strong design cues from its 1960s predecessor.</p>, <p>The brand also unveiled the Renault Emblème, a concept car aiming to tackle carbon <a>emissions</a> throughout its lifecycle. The model features a dual-energy electric powertrain, combining a rechargeable battery for everyday use with a hydrogen fuel cell for longer journeys.</p>, <p>Renault’s domestic rival, Citroën, had a large presence at the event too. The <a>manufacturer</a> premiered its C5 Aircross Concept. The model showcases a future C-segment SUV, which will be built on the Stellantis STLA Medium platform.</p>, <p>Also on the brand’s stand was the newly revealed C4 and C4 X, with both vehicles due to arrive in dealerships early next year.</p>, <h2><strong>Leaping into Europe</strong></h2>, <p>After forming a joint venture with Stellantis and recently launching operations in Europe, Leapmotor was also at the event. The carmaker attracted a large crowd during its press conference, which included Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares.</p>, <p>The brand hosted the global debut of the B10, a C-segment SUV and the first model in its B-series. Other Leapmotor models on display included the C16 mid-size SUV and T03 city car.</p>, <p>Peugeot showcased its new e-408. The C-segment BEV follows the release of a plug-in hybrid version in 2022.

This is yet another C-segment SUV, with three mild-hybrid powertrains and one full-hybrid option on offer.</p>, <p>Kia used the event to display its EV3, a compact electric B-segment SUV with high-tech features. It has a <a>range</a> of 375 miles (604km) when opting for its bigger battery.</p>, <p>One of its competitors will be the Skoda Elroq. The EV has a 560km range and prices start at around €33,000. It marks the beginning of six BEV Skoda model launches over the coming years.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, the Volkswagen Tayron made its public debut. The model is a seven-seat SUV that sits above the Tiguan.

José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, reviews the results with Autovista24 journalist Tom Hooker.</em></p>, <p>Tesla remained the best-selling brand in the <a>European</a> EV market at the end of August. It accounted for 10.9% of all plug-in registrations in Europe across the first eight months of the year. This was up 0.1 percentage points (pp) from July.</p>, <p>Despite this slight improvement, the carmaker is a long distance behind where it was at the same time last year. Between January and August 2023, the brand had a 12.3% market share. Tesla should take the 2024 title, but it will have a harder challenge retaining the top spot next year.</p>, <p></p>, <p>BMW was just 0.8pp behind, with a 10.1% share. In August 2023, Tesla’s nearest rival was Volkswagen (VW), which trailed the carmaker by 3.6pp.</p>, <h2><strong>The race for third</strong></h2>, <p>Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz took third in August. The brand captured 8.8% of the European <a>EV</a> market in the first eight months of the year, 1.3pp behind BMW. Volvo lost ground to the German carmaker in fourth. It dropped 0.1pp from July to 8.5%. The Volvo EX40, and its plug-in hybrid version of the XC40, dragged down the good results secured by the EX30.</p>, <p>Then came VW, which accounted for 6.7% of EV <a>registrations</a>. After a poor performance in the first half of the year, the marque appeared to be recovering. VW is 2pp behind its share from August 2023, when it sat in second. It is expected to finish the year outside the top three, which has not happened since 2019.</p>, <p>However, VW distanced itself from Audi, which lost 0.1pp market share in August to finish with 6.4%. The carmaker only has the <a>Q4 e-Tron</a> pulling volumes forward. Behind it came Kia with a 4.5% market hold, down 0.1pp from July. It closed the gap to Peugeot, with a 4.4% share.</p>, <h2><strong>VW Group’s stable lead</strong></h2>, <p>With brands gathered under manufacturing groups, VW Group kept a stable lead. The OEM captured a 20.4% share in the first eight months of 2024, stable on its result from last year. In the first eight months of 2024, it held a 9.4pp lead over its nearest competitor.</p>, <p></p>, <p>On the other hand, just 0.4pp separated second and fifth place. BMW Group edged past Stellantis for second, as both OEMs sat at an 11% share after gaining 0.1pp from July. BMW Group is depending on the success of the <a>iX1</a> and <a>i4</a>. The recent <a>i5</a> also provided extra volume so it could fight for second.</p>, <p>Despite sitting in fourth, Tesla is still the favourite to finish in the runner-up position by the end of the year. The carmaker took a 10.9% share between January and August, up 0.1pp. Geely-Volvo was stable in August, making up 10.6% of EV deliveries.</p>, <p>A little further behind was Mercedes-Benz Group in sixth, with a 9.1% share. It had a 1.2pp advantage over the Hyundai Motor Group, which captured 7.9% of the market.</p>, <p>Share this article</p>, <h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>, <h5><span>Discussing design at the 2024 Paris Motor Show</span></h5>, <p>18 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>BYD enjoys significant lead in global EV market</span></h5>, <p>16 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>Tesla Model Y drives global EV market in August</span></h5>, <p>15 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>BYD remains on top in China’s EV market</span></h5>, <p>10 October 2024</p>, <p>Top</p>, <p>Autovista24 © 2024</p>]"

José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, unpicks the brand and OEM performances with Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry.</em></p>, <p>BYD continued to lead the way in <a>China’s</a> EV brand rankings in September. The carmaker put 11 <a>models</a> in the <a>EV</a> top 20, which meant its dominance was never in doubt.</p>, <p>The carmaker recorded 32.9% of all plug-in <a>registrations</a> between <a>January</a> and September. This was up by 0.6 percentage points (pp) on BYD’s hold at the end of August. It also came close to capturing a third of the country’s entire EV market. It is unlikely to be challenged this year, with the nearest competition more than 26pp behind.</p>, <p></p>, <p>This performance suggests that BYD’s plan to sell numerous models in different segments is working. Its cumulative totals are greater compared to other brands that focus their efforts on one or two flagship vehicles.</p>, <h2><strong>Brands below BYD</strong></h2>, <p>The brand table was closer below BYD. While some marques benefitted from their own good results in September, others gained from the poor performances of others.</p>, <p>Tesla ended September with a 6.5% market share across the first nine months of 2024. The US carmaker increased its hold from 6.4% in August and appears comfortable in second.</p>, <p>Chinese brand Wuling profited from its strong September showing. Its models, the Mini EV and Bingo, ended the month in seventh and 11<sup>th</sup> positions respectively, giving its market share a boost. It held 5.2% of total deliveries across the year, up by 0.1pp compared to August.</p>, <p>Li Auto held on to fourth with a 4.8% market share. This was up 0.1pp from August. Geely was in fifth position with 4.3%, also increasing its share by 0.1pp from the previous month.</p>, <p>In sixth, Aito benefited from a poor monthly performance by Aion. Both the Aito M7 and M9 appeared in the top 20 models in September, in 15<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> place respectively. These deliveries helped the brand to consolidate its position with a 4.1% market share across the nine-month period.</p>, <p>Aion, on the other hand, did not feature any models in the top 20. Its Aion Y and Aion S vehicles remain in the yearly table, in 13<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> positions respectively. Yet, their performance in the month impacted the brand’s market share. The carmaker lost 0.1pp compared to August, to end September with 3.6% of the market, in seventh place.</p>, <h2><strong>BYD groups together</strong></h2>, <p>Looking at the figures of automotive groups and alliances, with carmakers brought together under their parent <a>companies</a>, the story is similar. BYD Group led China’s EV market comfortably, with a 34.6% share. This was an improvement of 0.6pp from the last report.</p>, <p>This increase in share is mostly thanks to the performance of the BYD brand itself. Denza, Fang Cheng Bao and Yangwang did not contribute as much to the group’s overall results.</p>, <p></p>, <p>However, this did not impact the company too much. It still dominates locally, with an almost 27pp gap to second. The OEM will likely end the year as the best-selling automotive group in China.</p>, <p>Geely-Volvo was a long way back in second, accounting for 7.7% of all EV deliveries in China. This was down 0.1pp from August. Geely’s good result in September was impacted slightly by the poorer performance of the group’s other brands. With these marques having a slow month, Geely-Volvo’s pace has slowed.</p>, <p>Tesla sat steady in third with its 6.5% market share, up 0.1pp from the previous month. Meanwhile, SAIC remained in fourth with a 6.1% hold, down 0.1pp month on month. The Chinese group has been unable to benefit from the strong September performance of its Wuling brand, due to weaker results from others.</p>, <p>In fifth, Changan remained stable with a market share of 5.8%. However, with SAIC so close, the group will be looking to overtake its domestic rival in the months ahead. It is also unlikely to be threatened from behind, with sixth-placed GAC dropping 0.1pp from August, to hold 4.6% of China’s EV market.</p>, <p>Share this article</p>, <h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>, <h5><span>On song BYD dominates record-breaking Chinese EV market in September</span></h5>, <p>11 November 2024</p>, <h5><span>Can retro model names boost BEV sales?</span></h5>, <p>01 November 2024</p>, <h5><span>Rivals close in on Tesla in European EV market race</span></h5>, <p>31 October 2024</p>, <h5><span>European EV decline driven by incentive effect</span></h5>, <p>30 October 2024</p>, <p>Top</p>, <p>Autovista24 © 2024</p>]"

José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, reviews the data with Autovista24 journalist Tom Hooker.</em></p>, <p>In September, the <a>European</a> EV market <a>returned to growth</a>, while Tesla extended its advantage as the region’s best-selling plug-in brand. Benefitting from an end-of-quarter delivery peak, the <a>manufacturer</a> increased its market share across the first nine months of 2024.</p>, <p>At the end of September, it accounted for 11.4% of all EV deliveries in Europe. This was 0.5 percentage points (pp) ahead of its result recorded in August. The performance will likely see Tesla secure its third EV <a>best-selling brand title</a> in a row.</p>, <p></p>, <p>However, despite this success, the brand’s competitors closed the gap compared to last year. In the first nine months of 2024, a market share difference of 1.4pp separated Tesla from its nearest rival. This was down from a 4.3pp lead recorded 12 months ago. The carmaker may, therefore, have a harder time replicating its success in 2025.</p>, <h2><strong>EV market share gains</strong></h2>, <p>BMW came second, accounting for 10% of deliveries from <a>January</a> to September. This was down 0.1pp from August. However, this was an improvement from its 8.1% share one year ago, as brands benefitted from Tesla’s reduced dominance.</p>, <p>BMW had a 1.3pp advantage over its domestic rival, Mercedes-Benz. The latter made up 8.7% of EV <a>registrations</a> in the first nine months of the year, dropping 0.1pp from August. Yet, Mercedes-Benz saw a 1.1pp improvement year on year.</p>, <p>Behind, Volvo lost ground to the top three, dropping to an 8.3% share in September from an 8.5% share in August. However, this result was an increase of 2.7pp from one year ago.</p>, <h2><strong>VW out of time?</strong></h2>, <p>In fifth, Volkswagen (VW) was the only marque other than Tesla to gain ground in September. It rose 0.3pp month on month, recording a 7% market share. Despite this improvement, it still sat 1.4pp behind its 2023 performance.</p>, <p>VW appeared in the European <a>EV</a> top three almost every year since 2015. Yet, the brand started 2024 poorly, with its registrations struggling in the first half of the year. Now recovering, a sales push is expected to try and reach third by the end of 2024, but time is running out.</p>, <p>Audi lost more ground to the top five in sixth place, with its 6.3% share down 0.1pp on August. However, its competitors were still a distance behind. Kia dropped from a 4.4% share in August to account for 4.2% of deliveries between January and September. Peugeot also lost ground, making up 4.2% of the market, down 0.2pp from the previous month.</p>, <h2><strong>Tesla jumps forward</strong></h2>, <p>With brands gathered under manufacturing groups, VW Group held a stable lead. The OEM took a 20.8% share of the European EV market in the first nine months of 2024. This was a 0.4pp improvement from August and 0.6pp ahead of the same period one year ago.</p>, <p></p>, <p>Tesla jumped up two positions to second in September, profiting from its expected end-of-quarter registration peak. It captured 11.4% of the market, up 0.5pp from August. However, this result was some distance behind its 12.7% share from 12 months ago.</p>, <p>BMW Group was also on the rise, thanks to strong performances from its Mini brand. The OEM accounted for 11.1% of deliveries, an increase of 0.1pp from August and 1.5pp year on year.</p>, <h2><strong>Stellantis slips</strong></h2>, <p>In fourth, Stellantis slipped 0.3pp to a 10.7% share from January to September. This was significantly below its 14% market hold recorded during the same period in 2023. Yet, if the ramp-up of its new <a>affordable EVs</a> goes smoothly, it could rebound in the fourth quarter.</p>, <p>This could make an interesting battle for second place, with Tesla, BMW and Stellantis all fighting for the position.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, Geely-Volvo was stable in fifth, capturing 10.5% of plug-in registrations. This was a 0.1pp decline from August but 2.7pp up year on year. If Stellantis encounters troubles in the fourth quarter, Geely-Volvo could catch the group ahead of it.</p>, <p>Mercedes-Benz Group was some distance behind in sixth. It reached a 9% share from January to September, down 0.1pp from the previous month. Yet, the result was an improvement from its 8.5% share in the first nine months of 2023.</p>, <p>Lastly, Hyundai Motor Group fell 0.2pp from August, making up 7.7% of the market in the year to date.

But which models helped to push the volume upwards? José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, reviews the latest data with Autovista24 editor Tom Geggus.</em></p>, <p>Combined global sales of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) increased 33% year on year in September. <a>EVs</a> accounted for 26% of the worldwide new-car market, with BEVs making up 16% alone.</p>, <p>Deliveries of the all-electric powertrain increased by 12% to roughly one million units in the month. Meanwhile, PHEVs recorded exceptional growth of 57%, reaching over 600,000 units.</p>, <p>BEVs made up 63% of the global EV market in September. A year ago, the technology accounted for 70% of the plug-in sales.</p>, <p>Between January and September, 11.7 million EVs were sold, accounting for 20% of the global new-car market. All-electric cars represented 12% singlehandedly, with 7.3 million deliveries.</p>, <h2><strong>Tesla Model Y leads</strong></h2>, <p>The Tesla Model Y led the EV market in September with some 121,084 registrations. The BYD Song came second, reaching 63,392 deliveries. Then, the Tesla Model 3 finished the month in third, recording 62,085 registrations.</p>, <p></p>, <p>The BYD Seagull, known as the Dolphin Mini in some markets, took fourth with a record 50,815 units. Then came the BYD Qin Plus in fifth with 50,815 deliveries.</p>, <p>In only its fourth month on the market, the BYD Qin L took sixth with 39,657 units. The Seal 06 claimed seventh with 38,276 registrations, a strong result in its third month on the market. The BYD Song L took 11<sup>th</sup> with 25,339 deliveries, its second record score in a row.</p>, <h2><strong>Record-breaking month</strong></h2>, <p>The best-selling EV from outside the Tesla and BYD marques was the Wuling Mini EV. The model surged ahead to ninth in September with 28,927 sales, its best result since February 2023. It unseated the Li Auto L6, which was the top non-Tesla, non-BYD model in <a>August</a>. Instead, the L6 ended the month in 10<sup>th</sup> with 25,393 deliveries.</p>, <p>Hitting a new best for 2024, the Wuling Bingo took 12<sup>th</sup> with 24,300 sales. This put it ahead of the BYD Dolphin by 4,011 units. The Geely Panda Mini also had a record-breaking month, with 17,551 deliveries putting it in 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>, <p>Outside of the top 20, the Geely Galaxy E5 recorded 14,250 deliveries in only its second month on the market. This model speaks volumes about Geely’s expectations for its compact crossover.</p>, <p>The Chery Fengyun T9 PHEV hit 11,156 sales in its fourth month on the market. Meanwhile, the Li Auto L7 recorded 13,476 registrations, its best result since January. Then the Huawei-backed Luxeed S7 managed a record 14,674 registrations, its first five-digit score.</p>, <p>The XPeng Mona M03 had an impressive introduction to the market, with 10,023 units delivered. It can be expected to join the top 20 soon.</p>, <p>Volkswagen (VW) Group saw the VW ID.3, VW ID.4, Audi Q4 and Skoda Enyaq reach above 10,000 units. This included a record 10,669 for the Enyaq. The results indicate that the MEB platform has become a success story, despite the carmaker’s current troubles. </p>, <h2><strong>A familiar top three</strong></h2>, <p>Between January and September, the Tesla Model Y and BYD Song continued to hold first and second respectively. The Tesla Model 3 recovered third from the BYD Qin Plus, ending the month ahead of the Chinese sedan by 18,190 units.</p>, <p></p>, <p>The Model 3 can be expected to retain this position through to the end of the year. The Tesla Model Y should finish first, followed by the BYD Song in second. This will effectively mirror the results recorded in 2023 and 2022.</p>, <p>This status quo is likely to be upset in 2025 though. The BYD Seagull will continue to grow and threaten the Tesla Model 3’s position, and maybe even challenge the BYD Song in second.</p>, <p>In eighth, the BYD Dolphin was the next model in a possibly precarious position. The Wuling Mini EV experienced a new wind which pushed it up to ninth across the first nine months of the year. This could indicate a close challenge for the BYD hatchback, should these strong results continue.</p>, <p>The Wuling Bingo jumped two positions to 12<sup>th</sup>, while the BYD Qin L took 13<sup>th</sup>. It looks set to climb a few more positions in the coming months. The new generation is preparing to take a spot in the top five next year. Finally, the Li Auto L6 was also on the rise, jumping four positions to 16<sup>th</sup>. Expect the midsize SUV to climb a few more positions by the end of 2024.</p>, <p>Share this article</p>, <h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRecommended\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>, <h5><span>Europe’s biggest used-car markets remain strong in third quarter</span></h5>, <p>18 November 2024</p>, <h5><span>European EV market grows for the first time since April</span></h5>, <p>15 November 2024</p>, <h5><span>On song BYD dominates record-breaking Chinese EV market in September</span></h5>, <p>11 November 2024</p>, <h5><span>Blessing or curse: The impact of EU tariffs on BEVs made in China</span></h5>, <p>07 November 2024</p>, <p>Top</p>, <p>Autovista24 © 2024</p>]"

This is a brand-new headset that hit the scene in September with a $300 price tag and is yet to have seen a price drop. Today’s deal at Target, though not a straight-up cash discount, lets you save $75 on the headset with a <a><strong>FREE</strong> gift card</a> that can go towards securing other deals that are now live at the retailer for <a>Black Friday</a>. Cashing in on this deal and securing the gift card essentially translates to scoring the headset for <a>$225 with a free $50 game</a>, which is great considering this is a brand-new headset that is less than two months old. Head below for more details of the headset.</p>, <p>The new <a>Meta Quest 3S</a> shares a lot of similarities with the Quest 3 model. It’s powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and also uses the same Touch Plus controllers that’ve come to know and love from its pricier sibling. This new model does have a bigger battery compared to the older one, meaning it’ll last you longer between the charges. The Quest 3S is slightly larger than the previous one, and it has the same 1832 x 1920 per-eye resolution displays to deliver crisp visuals. The headset also comes bundled with the latest <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> along with a 3-month trial of Quest+ to get a taste of Meta’s VR subscription.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for more deals on VR headsets, then <a>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 is down at <strong>$349</strong></a> right now. It even comes with the Horizon Call of The Mountain game as a bundle and is down from its usual price of $600. <a>PlayStation’s Black Friday 2024 deals</a> are also live right now with deals on PS5 bundles, games, DualSense controllers, and more, so be sure to check it out if you’re looking to save on a new console or some games ahead of the holiday season.</p>, <h3>Meta Quest 3S VR headset features:</h3>, <p><a>\n<em>Add 9to5Toys to your Google News feed.</em> \n\t\t\t\t\n\t<svg>\n<title>Google News</title>\n<use></use>\n</svg>\n</a></p>, <p><em>FTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on <a>affiliate links</a></em></p>, <p><a> Subscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more! </a></p>, <h2>Guides</h2>, <h3>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTarget\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h3>, <h3>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlack Friday 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h3>, <h2>About the Author</h2>, <h3>\n<a>\n<span>Karthik Iyer</span>\n</a>\n</h3>, <h3><span>Karthik Iyer's favorite gear</span></h3>, <h3>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnker’s 9-in-1 charging station with 100W USB-C\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h3>, <h3>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLISEN 2-in-1 MagSafe travel charging stand for iPhone 16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h3>, <h3>Popular in the Community</h3>]"

On top of that, the brand just unleashed its latest new release leather Apple Watch release, the <a>Ultra Leather Band</a>, and it is also eligible for your exclusive <a><strong>40%</strong></a> discount. Simply use code <strong>9to540</strong> at checkout on any of the Burton Goods bands to score the deal. And be sure to head below for a closer look at the brand new Ultra Leather Band. </p>, <h2>Massive 40% off all Burton Goods leather Apple Watch bands for 9to5 readers</h2>, <p>I am a huge fan of the brand’s <a>Heritage bands</a>, but the new Ultra Leather Band that just dropped might be its nicest release to date for me. While you will find leather straps across its product family for all Apple Watch models, the latest release is specifically tailored to Apple Watch users and is available with both Natural and Black Titanium finishes. </p>, <p>It takes on a more robust and less dainty approach than some of Burton’s other traditional straps, but still features that wonderful full-grain leather build alongside the timeless stitching details as well as a more vintage-style clasp. Another element of the design that really catches my eye in the best way possible is the sort of rounded, half moon leather pieces that meet right up against either side of your Apple Watch – it really makes the brand standout from the pack while still maintaining a timeless and traditional vibe. </p>, <h3>Features at a glance:</h3>, <p>Now available in<a> Bourbon and Mahogany brown shades at $89.95</a>, our exclusive <strong>9to540 </strong>code will drop your total down to <a><strong>$53.97</strong></a> – that’s a seriously wild deal for a brand new release. How many brands offer 40% off on a gorgeous piece of kit they just launched?</p>, <p>Our exclusive promo code, which is live through this weekend, will also work on the rest of the brand’s wonderful Apple Watch strap collection as well (seen above in the gallery). Here’s how pricing shakes out across the lineup after applying code <strong>9to540</strong> at checkout – all of the deals below are the best we have ever tracked by the way:</p>, <p>Apple Watch Heritage Leather Strap <a><strong>$48</strong> (Reg. $80)</a></p>, <p>Apple Watch Pilot Leather Strap <a><strong>$60</strong> (Reg. $100)</a></p>, <p>Burton Goods Logan Leather Cuff for Apple Watch <a><strong>$60</strong> (Reg. $100)</a></p>, <p>Burton Goods Leather Cuff For Apple Watch Ultra <a><strong>$72</strong> (Reg. $120)</a></p>, <p><a>\n<em>Add 9to5Toys to your Google News feed.</em> \n\t\t\t\t\n\t<svg>\n<title>Google News</title>\n<use></use>\n</svg>\n</a></p>, <p><em>FTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on <a>affiliate links</a></em></p>, <p><a> Subscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more! </a></p>, <h2>Guides</h2>, <h3>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBurton Goods\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h3>, <h2>About the Author</h2>, <h3>\n<a>\n<span>Justin Kahn</span>\n</a>\n</h3>, <h3><span>Justin Kahn's favorite gear</span></h3>, <h3>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h3>, <h3>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Watch Ultra 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h3>, <h3>Popular in the Community</h3>]"

        "html": "[<h1>Tesla dangles deals for new buyers who get their cars delivered by year's end as it tries to hit growth goal</h1>, <p>If you're thinking of buying a Tesla, now may be a good time.</p>, <p>Elon Musk is looking to deliver a record number of Teslas by the end of the year, so the car company is increasing its incentives with less than two months to go in 2024.</p>, <p>The EV giant is offering three months of free Supercharging and its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) beta software to customers who take delivery of a new inventory Tesla in North America by December 31. FSD usually costs $8,000.</p>, <p>It's important to note this doesn't mean you automatically get the incentives if you custom order a new Tesla.</p>, <p>\"New inventory vehicles\" refer to Teslas that are already built and ready to be delivered. The banner on Tesla's website says used vehicles and business orders are excluded from this deal, and the offer can't be postponed to a later date. So if you kit out a Tesla model that isn't built in time for you to take delivery this year, you're out of luck.</p>, <p>Tesla added the new promotion as it looks to make good on its guidance that it will grow vehicle deliveries this year. In its <a>third-quarter earnings</a>, Tesla predicted it would end the year with \"slight growth in vehicle deliveries\" despite a challenging landscape.</p>, <p>The EV maker delivered about 1,294,000 vehicles as of the third quarter and ended 2023 with 1.81 million total deliveries. If Tesla wants to beat last year's delivery numbers, that means it would need to deliver over 516,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter. <a>Wells Fargo analysts previously said they expect Tesla</a> to offer \"aggressive finance promos globally\" this quarter.</p>, <p>Tesla's latest offerings aren't the first time the EV maker has offered incentives to new buyers. In July, it <a>offered</a> three months of free Supercharging for buyers taking delivery of any Model S, 3, X, or Y by August 15. In August, Tesla introduced a $5,000 three-year bundle for its Model S and Model X, offering an FSD-supervised subscription, Supercharging, and premium connectivity.</p>, <p><a>Another incentive that may work in Tesla's favor</a> is the looming possibility that the US may rescind the $7,5000 federal tax credit awarded to those who purchase new EVs. <a>Trump is reportedly planning to get rid of the tax credit</a>, a benefit introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act. Musk has seemingly voiced his support, writing online: \"End all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas.\"</p>, <p>The threat of rising EV prices could push some would-be EV buyers to pull the trigger on a new Tesla before Trump takes office. Tesla's additional incentives simply sweeten the deal.</p>, <h2>\n                              Read next\n                            </h2>, <p>Jump to</p>]"

This is a significant accomplishment critical for the company and the automotive and technology sectors worldwide.</p>, <p>This increase in Tesla’s trading price results from the enthusiasm of investors and the flow of its chief executive officer, Elon Musk. This is the first-ever experienced record-making that pointed to the growth of Tesla, the prospects of EVs, and the critical role of Musk in charting the course for the company’s ascendancy.</p>, <h2>Tesla’s journey to dominating the EV market: From unknown to #1</h2>, <p>The unprecedented success story of Tesla getting to a $1 trillion market capitalization is a feature that has taken the company to new heights in the electric vehicle business. From a relatively unknown company over the past decade to the world’s most valuable automaker, leaving behind Toyota and Ford.</p>, <p>Combining this with Musk’s audacious leadership and the company’s strategic direction regarding electric automobiles, the company is in the vanguard of the automotive industry transformation. Tesla’s market capitalization is now more than three times that of its closest rival and, therefore, has become a dominant player in the automotive industry.</p>, <p>The market capitalization of Tesla increased following the win of Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Some investors believe that the Trump administration will support not only Elon Musk but also his projects, such as self-driving cars.</p>, <p>Musk, who has consistently supported Trump, expects federal laws to govern self-driving cars, benefiting Tesla and other firms interested in taking self-driving vehicles to the market. This, coupled with the possible unified federal regulation, has seen Tesla’s stock value rise significantly due to expectations that Trump will provide a better environment for the company to thrive.</p>, <h2>Musk’s leadership and vision: Key drivers behind Tesla’s extraordinary growth</h2>, <p>Elon Musk has remained controversial for many years; however, it cannot be put into question that he played a significant role in popularizing Tesla. As the CEO of the company, Musk has managed Tesla to walk through a range of difficulties regarding production, regulation, and others.</p>, <p>His power to control the market and his history of making brilliant and unique inventions made him a key figure in the growth of the Tesla company. The current worth of Musk, which stands at over $300 billion, embodies the genius he exercises in management and the confidence investors have in his ideas.</p>, <p>It is not just about making cars; it is about creating the worlds of tomorrow by someone who conceives the world as a technology, energy, and transportation problem.</p>, <h2>Tesla’s future: How innovation and global trends position it for success</h2>, <p>Tesla is a $1 trillion market cap company for the future of the global automotive and energy industries. While the global market is moving towards sustainable energy sources and electric cars, Tesla stands on the front line.</p>, <p>The technological advancement in battery, solar power, and energy storage systems is an additional stream closely related to the automotive market but makes the company stand out from competitors. With governments worldwide promoting carbon-neutral policies, Tesla’s prospects eclipse its EV market conquest, which is much more expansive.</p>, <p>In conclusion, it can be pointed out that Tesla managed to get the $1T MC, providing people with cars of the future under visionary leadership and in conditions of growing demand for EVs and SAEs and the growing opportunities for the industry’s players to evolve.</p>, <p>Tesla is one of the most innovative companies in the world, with Musk at the wheel, and it will define the future of transportation and energy. The prospects are rosy, and it is not the end of Tesla’s journey.</p>, <p> © 2024 by ECOticias </p>, <h3><span></span></h3>, <h3><span></span></h3>, <p>© 2024 by ECOticias</p>]"

The refreshed range is set to roll out in 2026, with Volkswagen’s R&amp;D chief describing the overhaul as “a much bigger change than expected.”</p>, <p>The new design philosophy will draw inspiration from the production version of the <a>VW ID.2all concept</a>, expected to debut in late 2025 or early 2026. This compact yet forward-thinking model will serve as the aesthetic blueprint for VW’s electrified future.</p>, <p><strong>Rooted in Heritage, Focused on the Future</strong></p>, <p>Kai Grünitz, Volkswagen Brand Board Member for Technical Development, shared fresh insights on the redesign during an interview with <em><a>Autocar</a></em> at the Los Angeles Auto Show. According to Grünitz, the revamped design direction is “going back to where we came from”, adding that it is closer “to what Volkswagen stands for.”</p>, <p><strong>More: <a>VW Brings Electric Tractors With Swappable Batteries To African Farms As Rentals</a></strong></p>, <p>While he didn’t specify which ID models will be updated first or the precise timeline for the rollout, industry reports suggest that VW’s entire electric lineup will be reimagined. The <a>ID.3</a> hatchback and ID.4/ID.5 SUVs, being among the earliest MEB-based models, are likely at the front of the queue for facelifts. </p>, <p>Meanwhile, the newer ID.7 sedan may follow suit, though the retro-cool ID.Buzz van might escape major exterior revisions. In typical VW fashion, the changes aim to refine rather than reinvent the lineup’s core appeal.</p>, <p><strong>MEB Evolution</strong></p>, <p>Beyond styling, the updates will deliver technical enhancements, including improved performance, lower battery costs, and “new functionality.” Grünitz hinted that these advancements will extend the MEB platform’s lifecycle until the next-gen SSP (Scalable Systems Platform) takes over, covering “everything from city cars to high-performance supercars”.</p>, <p>Volkswagen is clearly playing the long game with SSP, backed by its recent partnership with <a>Rivian</a>. Grünitz was quick to praise the US-based EV maker, describing it as “much leaner and faster than traditional OEMs” and comparable to the nimbleness of Chinese automakers. He also commended Rivian’s “best-in-class” OTA (over-the-air) software updates—a capability VW intends to adopt for its own electric arsenal.</p>, <p><strong>ID.2 To Spawn Electric SUV and Hot Hatch</strong></p>, <p>The next step for VW is to show an ID.2-based SUV concept at the 2025 Munich Motor Show. This study will be a preview for the second production EV to ride on the MEB Entry platform, following the ID.2 hatchback.</p>, <p>Enthusiasts have even more to look forward to: the ID.2 will evolve into the first-ever fully electric GTI. As previewed by the <a>ID.GTI Concept</a> in 2023, this hot hatch is set to debut in 2026, embodying the spirit of the Golf GTI. Grünitz teased that the model will blend nostalgia with innovation, delivering surprises that should resonate with VW loyalists and newcomers alike.</p>, <p></p>, <h2>Follow us on</h2>, <p>\n<a>Google News</a>\n</p>, <p>\n<a>MSN Start</a>\n</p>, <h2>Post navigation</h2>, <h2>\n                                        Thanos Pappas                                    </h2>, <h3>Associate Editor</h3>, <p>\n                                        Thanos Pappas, a product design engineer by trade, has been wading through automotive journalism for...                                         <a>\n<span>Read full bio</span>\n</a>\n</p>, <h3>Follow Us</h3>]"

        "html": "[<h1>Elon Musk Pushes Forward with His Boldest Project Yet: Launching the First Fully Autonomous Tesla Electric Car</h1>, <p><strong><em>Elon Musk is at it again, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and setting his sights on a new milestone: launching the first fully autonomous Tesla electric car. As someone who’s followed Tesla’s journey from its early days, it’s exciting to see how the company continues to innovate and challenge the status quo.</em></strong></p>, <p><span></span></p>, <h2>Chips, Chips, and More Chips for Tesla</h2>, <p>To make this ambitious vision a reality, <strong><a>Tesla</a> </strong>is ramping up its technological arsenal. The company has recently announced plans to significantly increase its orders of D1 chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. According to industry insiders cited by <em>The Economic Daily News</em> and <em>Boursier.com</em>, Tesla intends to double its D1 chip orders in 2024 to a total of 10,000 units. The demand is expected to grow even further in 2025.</p>, <p>These specialized chips are the heart of Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer, a state-of-the-art machine designed to process vast amounts of video data for training machine learning models. These models are crucial for advancing Tesla’s Autopilot system and Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities. With more chips powering Dojo, Tesla can accelerate the development of algorithms that help cars understand and react to real-world driving scenarios.</p>, <h2>A $1 Billion Bet Elon Musk Is Counting On</h2>, <p>Back in July, during a conference call with analysts, Elon Musk mentioned that Tesla would be investing over $1 billion in the Dojo project over the next year. This bold investment initially raised some eyebrows among investors, prompting Tesla to clarify that the funds would be allocated across research and development initiatives. Now, with the substantial increase in chip orders from TSMC, it’s clear that Tesla is putting its <strong><a>money</a> </strong>where its mouth is.</p>, <p><span><img/><span><svg><path></path></svg><span>Pin</span></span></span></p>, <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley have weighed in on this development, suggesting that the rapid adoption of robotaxis and network services powered by Dojo could add up to $500 billion to Tesla’s market capitalization. That’s half a trillion dollars, a figure that underscores the immense potential of autonomous driving technology.</p>, <p>The strengthened partnership between Tesla and TSMC not only highlights Tesla’s confidence in cutting-edge Taiwanese technology but also signals a significant boost for the semiconductor industry. As demand for advanced chips rises, we might see accelerated innovation in how these components are designed and produced.</p>, <h2>Bridging the Gap to Fully Autonomous Vehicles</h2>, <p>The journey to fully autonomous vehicles isn’t just about software; it’s equally about the hardware that can handle complex computations in real time. Tesla’s focus on developing its own supercomputer reflects a strategic move to control more aspects of the technology stack.</p>, <p>The Dojo supercomputer is designed to process data at unprecedented speeds, allowing Tesla to train its neural networks more efficiently. This means safer and smarter self-driving cars on the road sooner than we might have expected. It’s a bit like upgrading from a bicycle to a high-speed train in terms of computational power.</p>, <h2>What This Means for the Future of Driving</h2>, <p>As Tesla moves closer to launching fully autonomous electric cars, we’re on the cusp of a transportation revolution. Imagine a world where your car can drive you to work while you catch up on emails or relax with a book. Traffic efficiency could improve, and road safety might reach new heights with fewer accidents caused by human error.</p>, <p>Regulatory hurdles remain, of course. But with companies like Tesla making significant investments and advancements, those challenges seem increasingly surmountable. Organizations such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are closely monitoring these developments to ensure that when autonomous vehicles do become mainstream, they’ll be safe for everyone.</p>, <h2>A Personal Reflection</h2>, <p>I recall a time when electric cars were a rarity, and the idea of a self-driving vehicle seemed like pure science fiction. Fast forward to today, and not only are electric cars commonplace, but we’re also on the verge of seeing fully autonomous vehicles hit the streets. It’s a testament to how rapidly technology can advance when driven by visionaries willing to take bold risks.</p>, <h2>Conclusion</h2>, <p>Elon Musk’s push to launch the first fully autonomous Tesla electric car represents a significant leap forward in automotive innovation. By investing heavily in technologies like the Dojo supercomputer and partnering with industry leaders like TSMC, Tesla is setting the stage for a new era in transportation.</p>, <p>The road ahead is sure to be filled with challenges, but if history has taught us anything, it’s that audacious goals often lead to remarkable achievements. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast, a Tesla owner, or simply someone intrigued by the future of mobility, these developments are worth keeping an eye on.

So there will be a huge improvement, both in terms of the cost for us, but also benefit for the customers.”</p>, <p>Part of this update is also a reinvention of the interior design and interfaces, with the return of some physical buttons on the dash and centre console as seen on the <span>ID.2All</span> concept. A solid uplift in interior quality is also on the cards. </p>, <p>However, while the MEB platform will be improved, it will still maintain some of its key technical elements, including a rear-drive layout and sophisticated multi-link rear suspension. The switch to front-mounted motors and more rudimentary rear suspension design will be reserved for the smaller MEB Entry models. </p>, <p>More concise details have yet to be revealed, the 2026 launch date does line up with a traditional seven-year model cycle for VW, but this doesn’t mean the SSP platform which was meant to replace it has been scrapped. Instead, SSP development will continue, with developments from its <a>new joint-venture</a> with <a>Rivian</a> set to be applied right from launch on the first SSP models due from 2027-onwards.  </p>, <p><em><strong>Click here for our list of the </strong></em><a><em><strong>best electric cars</strong></em></a><em><strong>...</strong></em></p>, <p>Senior staff writer at Auto Express, Jordan joined the team after six years at evo<strong> </strong>magazine where he specialised in news and reviews of cars at the high performance end of the car market. </p>, <h4>Recommended</h4>, <h4><span>Volkswagen ID.3, ID.4 and ID.5 now nearly £5,000 cheaper thanks to new Pure models</span></h4>, <h4><span>Used Volkswagen ID.4 (Mk1, 2021-date) buyer’s guide: low prices make EV an attractive buy</span></h4>, <h4><span>Car Deal of the Day: all-electric VW ID.3 is great value at £192 per month</span></h4>, <h4><span>Car Deal of the Day: Volkswagen ID.4 is a classy all-electric family SUV for £228 per month</span></h4>, <h4>Most Popular</h4>, <p><span>New cars that plummet in value can make brilliant used buys</span></p>, <p><span>Best used cars to buy 2024</span></p>, <p><span>Jaguar concept car teased further in new image</span></p>, <p>Copyright Carwow Studio Limited 2024.

He said it will be the “starting point” for this new era for VW, “because customers will see there has been a change, and a much bigger change than expected”.</p>, <p>An SUV variant of the ID 2 will also be previewed at the Munich motor show in September 2025, Grünitz confirmed, as the second VW model to be built using the MEB Entry architecture.</p>, <p>A <a>GTI version of the ID 2</a> is also planned and has been previewed by a concept car. Grünitz said it is “easy” to add performance to electric cars but less so to add “DNA”, such as the characteristics attributed to GTI that have made Golf GTIs great in the past. However, Grünitz said the firm has “ideas that you’ll be surprised” by when the first electric GTI is launched in 2026. </p>, <p>Development of the <a>SSP (Scalable Systems Platform)</a> is also continuing, said Grünitz. This electric car base is considered the most significant long-term architecture for the Volkswagen Group because it will be able to underpin everything from city cars to supercars. </p>, <p>The joint venture launched last week with Rivian is significant for SSP because VW will tap into Rivian’s experience in electric architectures, which, Grünitz said, are particularly advanced and “best in class” for over-the-air software updates.</p>, <p></p>, <h4>Latest Reviews</h4>, <h5><a>Skywell BE11</a></h5>, <h5><a>Mercedes-Benz CLE 300e Coupe</a></h5>, <h5><a>Mercedes-Benz G-Class</a></h5>, <h5><a>Ford Explorer</a></h5>, <h5><a>Mazda CX-80</a></h5>, <p><a>View all car reviews</a></p>, <h2>Read our review</h2>, <h3><a>Volkswagen ID 3</a></h3>, <p>Volkswagen's electric hatchback receives mid-life updates to styling and that much-criticised interior</p>, <p>“They are much leaner and faster than traditional OEMs,\" he said. \"They're closer to what we see in China. We combine that with our knowledge of building cars to high-quality standards, so I think this is a good combination.”</p>, <p>Upcoming Euro 7 emissions rules will result in a “line-up that’s slimmer than today”, said Grünitz, although they will also result in more mild-hybrid options. He didn’t confirm which models will disappear but did say it won't be the Polo, which will receive an extensive update at the same time.</p>, <p>More broadly, Grünitz said investing in parallel architectures, such as the <a>MQB</a> for combustion-engined models and MEB for electric ones, is “a huge effort”, but there is no end date for the MQB architecture because electric car uptake has not been as predicted. Indeed, Grünitz said it is possible the firm could integrate electric powertrains into it once again as part of the options on the table for its development.</p>, <p>VW sales and marketing boss Martin Sander said ultimately it is “better for customers” to have dedicated architectures for the different technologies but as the firm looks to “the next generation, we have to find a very smart way of keeping [individual] features, but also using components across the platforms in intelligent way”.</p>, <p></p>, <h2><a>Mark Tisshaw</a></h2>, <p>Mark is a journalist with more than a decade of top-level experience in the automotive industry.

Here's The Latest Incentive.\t</h1>, <p><a><strong>Tesla</strong></a> (<a>TSLA</a>) is offering three free months of Supercharging and Full Self-Driving for North American buyers taking delivery of any new Tesla vehicle by year-end, even the Cybertruck. Tesla stock lost a fraction early Thursday.</p>, <p>CEO Elon Musk, on the Q3 earnings call, predicted that full-year deliveries would top 2023's total of 1,808,591. That would require Tesla to deliver more than 514,935 EVs in Q4, up from Q3's 462,890 and Q4 2023's record 484,507.</p>, <p>So Tesla has been straining to reach that goal. Tesla China sales have been solid, but largely flat vs. Q3's record pace. European sales have continued to slide.</p>, <p>So nearly all of Tesla's growth will have to come in the U.S. And the EV giant is pushing hard.</p>, <p>Wednesday's Supercharging and FSD incentive offer is the latest lever being pulled.</p>, <p>Earlier this week, Tesla cut the entry level Model Y lease to $299 a month from $349. That's now the same price as a entry-level Model 3 lease, even though the Model Y purchase price is $2,500 more than the Model 3.</p>, <p>Also this week, Tesla said Texans who take delivery by Dec. 31 can get a year of unlimited home charging for $5 a month vs. the usual $15 a month.</p>, <p>In late October, Tesla stopped selling the Foundation series Cybertruck and opened the non-Foundation series to anyone, not just reservation holders. The Cybertruck now starts at $79,990, or $20,000 less than before. At that price, the Cybertruck should soon be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit, though that hasn't happened yet.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, Tesla has been offering inventory discounts on Model 3 and Y vehicles for some time.</p>, <h2>Tesla Stock</h2>, <p>Shares lost 0.3% in premarket trade.</p>, <p>Tesla stock fell 1.15% to 342.03 on Wednesday, but is up 6.6% so far this week. TSLA stock has spiked nearly 37% so far in November, largely on hopes that Donald Trump will enact Tesla-friendly policies as president.</p>, <p><em>Please follow Ed Carson on Threads at <a>@edcarson1971</a> and X/Twitter at <a>@IBD_ECarson</a> for stock market updates and more.</em></p>, <p><strong>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:</strong></p>, <p><a>Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The</a><a> Sear</a><a>ch</a><a> For Top Stocks</a></p>, <p><a>Best Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch</a></p>, <p><a>IBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today</a></p>, <p><a>How To Invest: Rules For When To Buy And Sell Stocks In Bull And Bear Markets</a></p>, <p><a>Futures: AI Chip Stock Eyes Breakout After Nvidia Earnings</a></p>, <h2>Related news</h2>, <p>SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF</p>, <h2>Relative Strength Line: Good Guide For Buys And Sells In Postelection Bump</h2>, <p>\n<span>11/22/2024</span>\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking for an indicator to tell you when to stay in positions or depart.

That’s despite the fact that the entry-level Model Y is $2,500 more expensive to buy than the most affordable Model 3.</p>, <p>More EV Deals</p>, <p>Without any incentive in place, the Tesla Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $44,990, while the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive retails for $42,490 excluding destination.</p>, <p>The new lease deal applies to a 36-month contract with a $2,999 down payment and an annual mileage of 10,000 miles. It also means that Tesla is basically subsidizing $1,800 over three years for people who want to get a new Model Y instead of a Model 3–$50 per month for 36 months.</p>, <p>It’s worth noting that Tesla doesn’t offer a buy-out option at the end of their lease agreements, so it might just make more sense to get a Model Y instead of a Model 3 for the same money. It’s slightly bigger than its sedan counterpart and has a hatchback. At the same time, though, it’s getting a bit long in the tooth, whereas the Model got an update this year and has fresher looks. The Model Y’s 337-mile range rating is also lower than the Model 3’s 363 miles, and the zero to 60 miles per hour time of the crossover is 1.6 seconds behind the sedan.</p>, <p>Currently, there’s just one version of the Model 3 that’s more expensive to lease than its Model Y counterpart. The Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive costs $349/month to lease, while the Model Y Long Range AWD is $399/month. The Performance AWD versions of both models cost the same when leasing: $599/month.</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Tesla Model 3 Performance VS.

        "html": "[<h1>A 1,526bhp Chinese EV has smashed the four-door Nürburgring record*</h1>, <p>*Sort of. Xiaomi runs a test lap at the ‘Ring in a lightweight prototype, beats Porsche</p>, <p>A four-door car with 1,526bhp worth of electric horsepowers has managed to lap the Nürburgring in 6m 46.874s, making it not just the fastest four-door car to have done so, but the fastest <em>electric</em> car full stop.</p>, <p>Except, it sort of also hasn’t, because the four-door car in question was but a prototype. And a fully stripped-out one at that. Which means the <a>Porsche Taycan Turbo GT’s time of 7m 07.55s set earlier this year</a> – and the <a>Rimac Nevera’s 7m 05.298s just about holds</a>. For now.</p>, <p>It’s a whopper of a gauntlet to have thrown down, mind: a gauntlet in the shape of the <a>Xiaomi SU7 Ultra</a>, a car with “two V8s” and “one V6s”. Sadly, this does not mean what you and I think it means.</p>, <p>Instead, it means electricity, and lots of it. There’s a triplet of e-motors, to produce what Xiaomi is calling its ‘HyperEngine V8s’, able to spin right up to 27,200rpm, powered by a very powerful battery and able to generate that colossal horsepower figure.</p>, <h3>You might like</h3>, <h3><div>Need For Speed Underground developer: \"we didn't know what we had\"</div></h3>, <h3><div>Honda: “lot of enthusiasm” to build the wild Integra Type S HRC</div></h3>, <h3><div>Jag’s ‘Copy Nothing’ era begins… with key Polestar 4 feature</div></h3>, <h3><div>Alpine A290</div></h3>, <p>It will be, says Xiaomi, enough to propel the SU7 Ultra for two full-bore laps around the ‘Ring without break, though your internals might need one. Because this car’s been thoroughly, exhaustively set up to perform at specifically this place.</p>, <p>They’ve driven 3,000km across six weeks earlier this year honing the acceleration, cornering, braking and suspension, in preparation for a proper production version of the SU7 Ultra to have a crack at the ‘Ring at some point in 2025. Which is when you’ll be able to buy one for 814,900 yuan (just under £90k).</p>, <p>And it looks… good. The body’s been honed for max aero of course, able to generate 285kg of downforce which Xiaomi tells us is “comparable to that of a supercar”. Lots of it is made up of carbon fibre, and all of it is able to get a real move on when necessary: 0-62mph (with a one-foot rollout) takes a claimed 1.98s, 0-124mph takes just 5.86s, and it’ll top out at 217mph.</p>, <p>There are big fat brakes. Dual chamber air springs. “High performance continuous damping control” or the option of Bilstein coilovers. In short, it’s a thoroughly serious bit of kit.</p>, <p>So reckon Porsche, Tesla and Rimac should take this four-door car with 1,526bhp worth of electric horsepowers very seriously too?

        "html": "[<p>Search</p>, <p>Menu</p>, <h1>A £10k electric car with a 100-mile range would surely be a sales success</h1>, <h2>Mike Rutherford thinks there would be demand for an electric car with a modest 100-mile range if it only cost £10k</h2>, <p>How’s this for a genuine, urgently required, unapologetically modest, game-changing product for consumers still sceptical about the financial and other implications of <a>electric cars</a>? I’m calling it the 10:100 and arguing that it could be the most intriguing, symbolically accessible pure-electric car - complete with a standard spec that’s light on luxuries, and heavy on value.</p>, <p>The 10:100 would, I believe, gently persuade millions of still understandably cautious consumers that they really can be painlessly eased into affordable little EVs without traumatising themselves or their wallets. Trouble is, in British showrooms at least, no such product currently exists. </p>, <p>What I’m proposing is a stripped-out urban car (not a quadricycle, I hasten to add) that gets its 10:100 name courtesy of a £10k retail price and a 100-mile range. I confess I’m being a tad greedy because I’m expecting an entire electric car for around the same amount of money as a serious cyclist might pay for a hi-tech two-wheeler, or a ripped-off long-distance train commuter may have to stump up for an annual season ticket. But I’m being practical and realistic too, because the only way I could run a cheap EV for my slow, regular drives and commutes of only 10 or so miles, would be to have a petrol or hybrid car as back-up for higher-mileage trips. Know the feeling?   </p>, <p>If I turn mathematician for a moment, the 10:100 badge that I’m suggesting for my proposed car translates to a simple cost of £10k per 100 miles of range. This represents the affordable, potentially doable sweet spot, right? Er, maybe.   </p>, <p>Using an identical method of calculation (taking a car’s retail price and its claimed official range to work out how much it costs per 100 miles of range), the figure for the <a>Citroen Ami</a> quadricycle works out at almost £7,000 more expensive – at a shockingly high £16,728. The <a>2024 Auto Express Car of the Year</a>, the <a>Citroen e-C3</a>, comes in at a far more palatable £11k, while a <a>Tesla Model 3</a> Long Range RWD, although pricey at the point of purchase, works out at £10,318 per 100 miles of range.</p>, <p>But the clear and unexpected winner in this exercise is the <a>Kia EV3</a>, which will officially do 375 miles for £35,995 – therefore costing only £9,598 on identical terms. That’s impressively inexpensive for an EV. In terms of value for money of product, my calculator tells me that nothing beats this car at this price.  </p>, <p>That said, the idea of a £10k pure-electric car with a non-negotiable 100-mile range still floats my boat. Is any manufacturer out there brave enough to design, build and sell it in Blighty?</p>, <p><em><strong>Do you agree with Mike?

        "html": "[<h1>Researchers develop low-cost battery material that could make electric cars cheaper than ever</h1>, <p>Researchers develop low-cost battery material that could make electric cars cheaper than ever.</p>, <p>Making electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper and greener has long been held back by costly battery materials. Traditional lithium-ion batteries, packed with expensive metals like cobalt and nickel,<strong> push up EV prices and raise environmental concerns. </strong></p>, <p>However, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology say they’ve found a breakthrough — a low-cost <strong>cathode material</strong> that could have a massive impact on the EV market by <strong>slashing battery costs</strong>, making EVs and large-scale energy storage much more affordable.</p>, <p>Led by the institute's Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Hailong Chen and his research team, the development revolves around a lithium-ion battery (LIB) that’s <strong>not only more sustainable but also significantly cheaper</strong> than the current options on the market. </p>, <h2>A 'game changer' for the EV market</h2>, <p>Lithium-ion batteries have a long history in personal electronics, helping to power everything from smartphones to laptops. Since their debut in the 1990s, these batteries have <strong>become critical for </strong><strong>electric vehicles</strong>, where they provide high-density, rechargeable energy. </p>, <p>However, for large-scale applications like EVs, the price remains a significant barrier since it can <strong>make up about half of an EV’s total cost, </strong>which hinders the broader adoption of clean-energy vehicles.</p>, <p>Chen and his team's innovative cathode uses a fresh <strong>iron chloride (FeCl₃) cathode </strong>- a material that’s both abundant and inexpensive, costing just 1-2% of the price of typical LIB cathodes. This means that the new cathode could help tackle the issue of EV adoption by reducing battery costs by around 30-40%. </p>, <p> “For a long time, people have been looking for <strong>a lower cost, more sustainable alternative to existing cathode materials</strong>. I think we’ve got one,” said Chen. “Our cathode can be a game-changer.” </p>, <p>Chen’s team discovered the breakthrough when working with <strong>chloride-based materials</strong> after facing challenges with traditional oxide-based cathodes. </p>, <p>“We found a candidate (FeCl₃) worth trying, as its crystal structure is potentially suitable for<strong> storing and transporting Li ions</strong>, and fortunately, it functioned as we expected,” Chen explained.</p>, <p>By using FeCl₃, which is made from elements as common as iron and chlorine, the cathode was able to<strong> avoid the need for costly and environmentally damaging materials</strong> like cobalt and nickel.</p>, <p>The initial tests of FeCl₃ show promise, with the cathode achieving similar or superior performance compared to standard materials. For instance, FeCl₃ operates at a higher voltage than LiFePO₄ (lithium iron phosphate), a widely used cathode. Higher voltage <strong>allows for more efficient energy transfer,</strong> similar to increased water pressure from a hose.</p>, <p>“This could not only make EVs much cheaper than internal combustion cars, but it provides <strong>a new and promising form of large-scale energy storage</strong>, enhancing the resilience of the electrical grid,” Chen said. “In addition, our cathode would greatly improve the sustainability and supply chain stability of the EV market.”</p>, <p>In related news, Europe’s ambitious move towards self-sufficient battery production is facing hurdles. Northvolt’s gigafactory near the Arctic Circle in Skellefteå, Sweden — touted as Europe’s first homegrown battery plant — was expected to power the continent’s green transition with low-carbon “green batteries” for electric vehicles. But <a>recent setbacks</a>, including BMW cancelling a major contract, have stalled the factory's expansion and led to significant lay-offs. </p>, <p><strong><em>Reference of the news:</em></strong> </p>, <p>Chen, H. et al.

Ford said it hoped to make the majority of job cuts through voluntary redundancy.<!-- --></p>, <p>“Making this announcement isn’t something that anybody wants to do, and I appreciate it will have a very significant impact on our employees,” said Lisa Brankin, managing director of Ford of Britain and Ireland.<!-- --></p>, <p>“It’s not the news anyone wants to hear at any time. So our aim is to try to deliver this through voluntary redundancy.\"<!-- --></p>, <p>Ford has 5,300 employees in the UK.<!-- --></p>, <p>A government spokesperson told the BBC it has \"asked the company to urgently share its full plans so we can help mitigate the impact in the UK\".<!-- --></p>, <p>The restructuring plan will remove 15% of its workforce. The majority of them are expected to be administrative or product development roles.<!-- --></p>, <p>The company currently makes diesel engines for vans at its Dagenham factory in Essex.<!-- --></p>, <p>It builds gearboxes in Halewood and is in the final stages of creating a major new facility for producing motors for electric vehicles on the site.<!-- --></p>, <p>Both factories are being protected from the cuts, along with Ford’s transport operations division, which is based in Southampton.<!-- --></p>, <p>However, six other sites across the UK could be affected, including a major research and development centre at Dunton in Essex, where it also has its UK headquarters, and a giant parts distribution centre in Daventry.<!-- --></p>, <p>This is the second round of cuts to hit Ford’s operations in Britain in less than two years. In March 2023 it said <!-- --><a>1,300 jobs were to go<!-- --></a>, a fifth of its workforce, most of them at the Dunton site.<!-- --></p>, <p>The latest announcement comes at a time when car manufacturers across Europe are struggling.<!-- --></p>, <p>Among the issues they face are high energy costs, weaker than expected demand for electric cars and growing competition from Chinese manufacturers.<!-- --></p>, <p>Many of the continent’s biggest names, including Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz and BMW have seen their profits tumble this year.<!-- --></p>, <p>Volkswagen is even contemplating the closure of factories in Germany, a step that would be unprecedented.<!-- --></p>, <p>“The automotive industry is going through a period of massive disruption at the moment,” explained Ms Brankin.<!-- --></p>, <p>“We’ve got unprecedented competition, regulation and lots of economic headwinds”<!-- --></p>, <p>Those pressures are hitting Ford at a difficult time. The carmaker is attempting to move away from its past as a mass-manufacturer of cheap \"runabouts\", and position itself as more upmarket brand, focused on electric cars. Last year,<!-- --><a> it stopped making the Fiesta<!-- --></a> after nearly five decades.<!-- --></p>, <p>In addition to the cuts in the UK, Ford will be shedding 2,900 jobs in Germany and another 300 in the rest of Europe.<!-- --></p>, <h2>EV targets 'will not be weakened' despite pressure<!-- --></h2>, <h2>JLR halts UK Jaguar sales before electric relaunch<!-- --></h2>, <h2>Ford scales back EV plans citing price pressures<!-- --></h2>, <p>Meanwhile in Britain, the government <!-- --><a>is coming under intense pressure from the car industry<!-- --></a> over rules designed to force them to build more electric vehicles. The issue is due to be discussed at a meeting between industry and ministers on Wednesday afternoon.  <!-- --></p>, <p>Under the so-called Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate, which came into force this year, at least 22% of cars sold must be classed as zero emission. If manufacturers fail to hit their quotas, they could face fines of up to £15,000 per car.<!-- --></p>, <p>A number of carmakers are already struggling to meet their targets, although there are flexible mechanisms built into the rules which should allow them to avoid fines for the moment.<!-- --></p>, <p>But the quota is due to rise to 28% next year, and to 33% in 2026 – being ramped up each year after that to hit 80% by 2030.<!-- --></p>, <p>Manufacturers insist this is happening too fast. Although sales of new EVs are rising – with one in five cars sold in October being battery powered, they say this is misleading.<!-- --></p>, <p>They claim demand for electric cars simply isn’t high enough yet, forcing them to offer unsustainable discounts in an effort to meet their targets.<!-- --></p>, <p>Some are calling for the government to water down the quotas, in order to give them more time.<!-- --></p>, <p>Others say it needs to offer greater taxpayer-funded incentives for electric cars, and to do more to reassure car buyers that enough charging infrastructure will be built.<!-- --></p>, <p>But according to Vicky Read, chief executive of charging firm Charge UK a weakening of the mandate would be the wrong move.<!-- --></p>, <p>\"The government must hold its nerve and use the meeting to signal support for a policy that is evidently working,\" she said.<!-- --></p>, <p>A government spokesperson said it is \"determined to work in close partnership with industry as we implement the 2030 transition deadline\".<!-- --></p>, <h2>'Trust and reserve judgement' on rebrand, says Jaguar<!-- --></h2>, <h2>Award for stock exchange as London office opens<!-- --></h2>, <h2>More tenants could be excluded from Right to Buy<!-- --></h2>, <h2>Funding for charity helping young people find work<!-- --></h2>, <p>A charity which helps young people learn the skills to find jobs has been given £249,000.</p>, <h2>Madonna's Jaguar goes up for auction<!-- --></h2>, <p>The rare 1967 Jaguar Mark X 4.2 Madonna gifted to her son is to go on sale in Weybridge. </p>, <h2>How is the world doing on tackling climate change?<!-- --></h2>, <p>Emissions from burning fossil fuels are still rising, but the rapid growth of wind and solar power offers hope</p>, <h2>EV targets 'will not be weakened' despite pressure<!-- --></h2>, <p>Transport Secretary Louise Haigh says the rules will remain, but car firms warn they are too strict.</p>, <h2>JLR halts UK Jaguar sales before electric relaunch<!-- --></h2>, <p>JLR says it is a deliberate plan with a new model produced in Solihull launching next month.</p>, <h2>Follow BBC on:</h2>, <p>Copyright 2024 BBC.

Of the world's biggest economies, China is a major culprit, but far from the only one.<!-- --></p>, <p>This is despite warnings from the UN that, if all the coal, oil and gas from existing and under-construction projects were burned, the world would likely warm far beyond the <!-- --><a>globally agreed target of 1.5C<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p>, <h2>A simple guide to climate change<!-- --></h2>, <h2>What is COP29 and how will Trump’s election affect the climate talks?<!-- --></h2>, <h2>Renewables: Rapid growth is encouraging<!-- --></h2>, <p>Renewable sources of energy like wind and solar are growing very quickly and prices have fallen considerably over the past decade.<!-- --></p>, <p>Last year, countries promised to triple the capacity of so-called 'renewables' by 2030.<!-- --></p>, <p>The idea is that these clean sources should start to displace dirty fossil fuels in the electric power grid, therefore reducing CO2 emissions even as electricity demand grows.<!-- --></p>, <p>Currently, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects global renewable capacity to grow 2.7 times by 2030 compared with its 2022 level - so not quite on track for a trebling, but close.<!-- --></p>, <p>The hope is that economics, as much as climate policy, can help renewables to grow even faster.<!-- --></p>, <p>“In many cases and for many countries, renewable energy is already the cheapest and the economically sane option for producing energy,” said Prof Joeri Rogelj of Imperial College London.<!-- --></p>, <p>China alone is expected to account for more than half of the growth in global renewable capacity to 2030, according to the IEA. But renewables are also set to rise quickly in the EU, US and India, as well as the UK.<!-- --></p>, <p>Batteries and other forms of energy storage are key to the expansion of renewables: while a fossil fuel-driven power station can be fired up at any time of the day, the wind doesn't always blow and the Sun doesn't always shine.<!-- --></p>, <h2>Electric vehicles: Numbers rising but it's a mixed picture<!-- --></h2>, <p>The number of electric vehicles (EVs) is growing quickly, led by China, but rates of uptake vary considerably between countries.<!-- --></p>, <p>They are the main way to reduce planet-warming emissions from road transport, according to the UN.<!-- --></p>, <p>That is because they can be powered by clean electricity, rather than directly from fossil fuels.<!-- --></p>, <p>The cost of EVs differs widely between nations.<!-- --></p>, <p>In China, the IEA estimates that more than 60% of electric cars sold in 2023 were already cheaper than their petrol or diesel equivalent, partly thanks to government subsidies to the industry, encouraging more people to make the switch. <!-- --></p>, <p>In other regions, electric cars have typically been more expensive, but are generally getting cheaper.<!-- --></p>, <p>In the UK, for example, the recent growth in EV sales is partly thanks to obligatory government targets, explained Colin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. <!-- --></p>, <p>\"As prices are driven down, more families are able to access the savings that come from electric driving,\" he said.<!-- --></p>, <h2>Deforestation: Mixed progress<!-- --></h2>, <p>Deforestation fell significantly in Brazil's Amazon in 2023 but the world remains far off track to meeting its target of<!-- --><a> halting it by 2030<!-- --></a>, according to the World Resources Institute.<!-- --></p>, <p>There have been some encouraging signs. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva came back to power in 2023, recommitting to that goal and promising to tackle tree loss. His predecessor Jair Bolsonaro had significantly weakened legal protections for the forest.<!-- --></p>, <p>This is a region that has historically helped to buffer the world from further warming, by absorbing some of the carbon dioxide produced from human activities.<!-- --></p>, <p>But there are concerns that this is changing as a result of tree losses and <!-- --><a>the effects of drought worsened by climate change<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p>, <p>Deforestation increased in other parts of the Amazon, including the part in Bolivia. <!-- --></p>, <p>“We must learn from the countries that are successfully slowing deforestation,” said Mikaela Weisse, Global Forest Watch Director at the World Resources Institute.<!-- --></p>, <p>Claudio Angelo from Brazil's Climate Observatory said that in the case of his country, while measures like punishing people for felling trees had been successful it was also important to focus on promoting things like sustainable agriculture.<!-- --></p>, <p>\"Brazil has been very good at the stick so far, but with the carrot we haven't been that good,\" he said.<!-- --></p>, <h2>So what's the big picture?<!-- --></h2>, <p>While a lot of positive steps have been taken, the headline figures on emissions have sadly not changed much.<!-- --></p>, <p>A recent UN report warned that current policies <!-- --><a>put the world on track for around 3C warming by the end of the century<!-- --></a>. Other organisations have come up with similar figures.<!-- --></p>, <p>This is clearly far above the target to try to limit long-term warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which was agreed by nearly 200 countries <!-- --><a>in Paris in 2015<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p>, <p>The UN says that the 1.5C target is still “technically possible”, but only with huge cuts to emissions over the next decade.<!-- --></p>, <p>The recent US election has also posed challenges for uniting the world around new climate targets. Incoming president Donald Trump has pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and “drill, baby, drill” for more oil and gas.<!-- --></p>, <p>This is “a major blow to global climate action,\" according to Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief.<!-- --></p>, <p>\"But it cannot and will not halt the changes under way to decarbonise the economy and meet the goals of the Paris agreement.”<!-- --></p>, <h2>A simple guide to climate change<!-- --></h2>, <h2>What is COP29 and how will Trump’s election affect the climate talks?<!-- --></h2>, <h2>UN climate talks 'no longer fit for purpose' say key experts<!-- --></h2>, <h2>Standing ovation as long awaited COP29 finance deal agreed<!-- --></h2>, <h2>Watch: Dozens of nations walk out of COP29 climate talks<!-- --></h2>, <h2>Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?<!-- --></h2>, <h2>Group warns climate change risks quality of life<!-- --></h2>, <p>A wildlife trust says climate change can effect soil, drinking water and air pollution.</p>, <h2>Inside the London landmark where they're trying to save the Earth<!-- --></h2>, <p>Part of a building that was once the home of London's local politics is now dedicated to another cause.</p>, <h2>Fifth proposal for solar farm in county 'worrying'<!-- --></h2>, <p>The scheme is criticised but Prime Minister Keir Starmer claims communities could directly benefit.</p>, <h2>The world's greatest unpaid debt?<!-- --></h2>, <p>Should rich countries and fossil fuel companies pay for the climate losses and damages they have caused?</p>, <h2>Firms given multi-million pound heat pump funding<!-- --></h2>, <p>Ideal Heating and Gledhill will share £5.2m to increase production of heat pump technology.</p>, <h2>Follow BBC on:</h2>, <p>Copyright 2024 BBC.

which would compete with rivals including Alphabet-owned Waymo - would cost less than $30,000 (£23,000).<!-- --></p>, <p>However analysts have cast doubt on how realistic that plan is.<!-- --></p>, <p>\"It will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timescale,\" said Paul Miller, from research Forrester.<!-- --></p>, <p>\"Without external subsidies, or Tesla making a loss on every vehicle, it doesn't seem plausible to launch at anything close to that price this decade,\" he added.<!-- --></p>, <h2>Safety concerns<!-- --></h2>, <p>Mr Musk also said he expected to see \"fully autonomous unsupervised\" technology available in Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California next year \"with permission where ever regulators approve it.\"<!-- --></p>, <p>But that approval is far from guaranteed.<!-- --></p>, <p>\"It is a big chunk of metal driving on roads at high speeds, so safety concerns are big,\" said Samitha Samaranayake, an associate professor in engineering at Cornell University.<!-- --></p>, <p>Tesla's self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors' vehicles.<!-- --></p>, <p>By teaching its cars to drive, Tesla plans to use <!-- --><a>artificial intelligence<!-- --></a> (AI) trained by the raw data it collects from its millions of vehicles.<!-- --></p>, <p>But the research community \"is not sold on whether the Tesla style of doing things can give the safety guarantees that we would like,\" Mr Samaranayake said.<!-- --></p>, <h2>Playing catch up<!-- --></h2>, <p>The cybercab project has undergone delays, having originally been <!-- --><a>due<!-- --></a> for release in August.<!-- --></p>, <p>This summer, <!-- --><a>in a post on X <!-- --></a>, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said the wait was due to design changes he felt were important.<!-- --></p>, <p>Meanwhile, competing robotaxis are already operating on some US roads.<!-- --></p>, <p>Tesla also seems poised to post its first ever decline in annual sales as competitors pile into the electric vehicle market, even as sales have softened.<!-- --></p>, <p>Despite that dour backdrop, Tuesday's event was heavy on spectacle - complete with Tesla's humanoid robots dancing and serving drinks to attendees.<!-- --></p>, <p>Mr Musk also unveiled another prototype for a \"Robovan\" which can ferry up to 20 passengers around at a time.<!-- --></p>, <p>The sleek shuttle \"could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,\" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person.<!-- --></p>, <p>Another analyst said the event felt like a step back into memory lane while also signalling the path ahead.<!-- --></p>, <p>\"Musk did a fantastic job of painting an ideal future for transportation that promises to both free up our time and increase safety,\" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.<!-- --></p>, <p>But despite the showmanship, there are doubts about whether he can deliver the vision he sketched out.<!-- --></p>, <p>\"Many questions remain about how this will be achieved from a practical standpoint,\" Caldwell added.<!-- --></p>, <h2>State of the robotaxi market<!-- --></h2>, <p>The deployment of robotaxis has encountered setbacks, with driverless cars operated by General Motors subsidiary <!-- --><a>Cruise being suspended in San Francisco<!-- --></a> after a pedestrian was knocked down.<!-- --></p>, <p>But the sector continues to expand. <!-- --></p>, <p>Waymo <!-- --><a>said<!-- --></a> in early October it would add the Hyundai Ioniq 5 to its robotaxi fleet after the vehicles undergo on-road testing with the company's technology.<!-- --></p>, <p>Ride-hailing giant Uber also wants to add more autonomous vehicles to its fleet to expand on its delivery and ridesharing options for customers.<!-- --></p>, <p>It <!-- --><a>announced<!-- --></a> a multi-year alliance with driverless car developer Cruise in August.<!-- --></p>, <p>Chinese tech company Baidu is also <!-- --><a>reportedly<!-- --></a> looking to expand its robotaxi division, Apollo Go, beyond China -

        "html": "[<p>Chime in with article commenting.</p>, <h1>Volkswagen ID. Buzz Dealer Markups Are Here, Even Though VW Said 'Don't'</h1>, <h2>\n                VW \"strongly discouraged\" dealers from marking up the ID Buzz—they're doing it anyway.            </h2>, <p>I'm shocked. <em>Shocked</em>, I tell you. Shocked to learn that dealers are ignoring Volkswagen's <a>now-former CEO's</a> strongly-worded caution for dealerships <em>not</em> to add additional dealer markup the already expensive ID Buzz.</p>, <p>Okay, well, maybe not <em>that</em> shocked. But it's happening—dealerships are doubling down on Volkswagen's egregiously-priced electric people hauler by adding markups as high as $15,000, effectively locking out consumers who were already stretched thin on their budget following the German automaker's <a>surprisingly high price announcement</a> earlier this year.</p>, <p>Recent news popped up when a Redditor reached out to Herman Cook Volkswagen in Encinitas, California. The salesperson <a>reportedly told</a> the potential customer to expect a markup of between $10,000 and $20,000 on the ID Buzz—when the individual iterated VW corporate's instructions <em>not</em> to markup the Buzz, the salesperson thanked the would-be customer for their time and ended the conversation. InsideEVs reached out to the dealership and was told that the dealer had not yet decided on a markup but it would likely be between $10,000 and $15,000.</p>, <p>As it turns out, that seems to be the norm.</p>, <p>Another Redditor <a>posted a screenshot</a> of an email reportedly with Castle Volkswagen of Downers Grove, Illinois. The salesperson said that \"due to demand,\" the dealership would be asking \"around $10k over MSRP.\" The dealership confirmed to InsideEVs that it would \"follow the market\" and seek between $5,000 and $10,000 over sticker.</p>, <p>\"Price [gouging] at its best,\" wrote the Redditor. \"This dealership shouldn’t be allowed to operate.\"</p>, <p>Another <a>two</a> <a>posters</a> cited additional dealership experiences in the $10,000 ADM range. And another in Oakland, California citing a $15,000 markup just to have the opportunity \"<a>to be one of the first people with a Buzz</a>.\" Another with an additional $8,000 on top—which put the vehicle within just <a>$3,000 of a Porsche Macan</a>. Of course, some were more reasonable, with a <a>markup of just around $4,000</a>, but that's still a far cry from the markup-free experience that the public assumed it would have with the launch of the Buzz.</p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>A Swing (And Miss) At Nostalgia</h2>, <p>The ID Buzz looked to be one of the most exciting Volkswagens in years. A halo product meant to invoke BMW levels of emotion in owners—a feel-good family mobile with a nod to the 70s that tugged on the heartstrings of just about anybody who ever fantasized about owning a modern VW bus. I mean, folks were <em>actually excited</em> about owning one of these things which speaks volumes for vee-dub in modern times.</p>, <p>Then came the official debut with full specs and a price tag. Let's just say that reception was less-than-stellar. In fact, it might not be far off as to say that Volkswagen shot itself in the foot with the launch, because <a>the internet was straight-up pissed</a>.</p>, <p>First was the price. Would-be buyers expected the Buzz to be priced somewhere around other minivans—you know, in the $40,000-ish range. But, of course, this is a BEV we're talking about, so price parity isn't going to happen. But look at the Kia EV9—Kia managed to throw enough incentives at the family SUV to get it into the mid-$40,000s, so surely VW would do something similar?</p>, <p>Nope. The lowest-trimmed single motor Buzz starts at $59,995 before the $1,550 destination fees, all the way up to $69,995 for its Buzz Pro S with dual motors, an iconic dual-tone paint job, and a myriad of tech-first features. That pricing put the ID Buzz out of reach of many would-be buyers, and its abysmal 231 miles of range was enough to shock many others.</p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>A Problem Volkswagen Can't Afford</h2>, <p>Here's the problem: these aren't just grumpy customers taking out inflation-induced infuriation on VW—this is a headache that Volkswagen can't afford right now.</p>, <p><a>VW is hurting big time</a>. Its CFO articulated that the brand has \"<a>maybe two</a>\" years to get it together or else succumb to the mounting pressure that is <a>global EV brands who can do things cheaper and more focused</a>. Its ID family of vehicles has been underperforming expectations and feeling the squeeze from Tesla, Ford, Hyundai, and others. The ID Buzz was supposed to inject some new life into VW's lineup and excite buyers. Maybe even give them a reason to try out other ID cars.</p>, <p>Before it even announced the price, Volkswagen knew it couldn't afford markups on the Buzz. That alone should have been a key indicator that the automaker expected a high price on the model.</p>, <p>“We cannot make a mistake [with the ID Buzz]. With respect to the customer, let’s discuss it. We have a good relationship with the [dealer] network,” said former CEO of VW North America, Pablo Di Si, who was recently ousted from his position after just two years. “We cannot have markups.”</p>, <p>So here we are, in EV purgatory with the ID Buzz. It is too expensive for what it offers, too beloved to be ignored, and increasingly vulnerable to dealer markups. If Volkswagen does nothing, it can kiss new sales of its flagship product goodbye. And if it tries to punish dealers, then it needs to use its teeth instead of just empty words.</p>, <p>More VW ID Buzz News</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

And no, your eyes are not deceiving you. Despite this being a website that specializes in writing about battery-powered cars, we need to recognize that <a>BMW</a> has mastered the art of producing a thrilling gas-powered four-door sedan that you can comfortably drive every day and take to the track now and then.</p>, <p>But here’s where the <a>new Tesla Model 3 Performance</a> comes into play. With new tech under the skin, such as better brakes and a fancy suspension, <a>Tesla</a>’s sportiest EV takes things up a notch and promises to be the best all-rounder, period. But is it so? Until we can get our hands on both a BMW M3 Performance xDrive and a Tesla Model 3 Performance, we’ll go by Jason Cammisa’s and Randy Pobst’s words, which were nicely laid out in the <a><em>Hagerty</em></a> video embedded below.</p>, <p>As a reminder, Camissa is a bona fide car journalist with two decades of experience reviewing cars, while Pobst is a multiple SCCA World Challenge GT champion.</p>, <p>More Stuff Like This</p>, <p>One of the biggest issues with the previous Model 3 Performance models was their inability to run multiple track laps at full speed without experiencing brake fade or some sort of powertrain limitation due to overheating. Now, though, it looks like Tesla dialed everything just right, with no brake fade after several hot laps in the Track Endurance mode. That said, the Endurance mode limits the EV’s top speed to preserve longevity, and it shows in the lap times.</p>, <p>After 15 minutes of continuous driving, the BMW M3 Competition was over 5,000 feet ahead of the Tesla Model 3 Performance, so there’s still work to be done. In a single-lap shootout, the M3 was also quicker than the Model 3, but by less than two seconds, with the EV’s biggest drawback being its tires.</p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: Tesla Model 3 Performance 2024            </h2>, <p>As a daily driver, though, the Model 3 Performance is a great sports-oriented car, not just EV. The infotainment is great, although it doesn’t have Apple CarPlay, and the charging experience is excellent. However, the fact that there are no steering column stalks makes the Model 3 “dangerous,” according to Cammisa.</p>, <p>At the end of the day, however, the biggest issue is the price. The 2025 BMW M3 Sedan with rear-wheel drive and 473 horsepower starts at $76,000. Upgrading to the M3 Competition with xDrive all-wheel drive and 523 hp ups the price to $85,000. Add some options and you’ll soon pass the $100,000 mark.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, the Tesla Model 3 Performance, with dual-motor all-wheel drive and 510 hp, starts at $54,990. But, unlike BMW, Tesla doesn’t really sell optional extras, so what you see is what you get.</p>, <p>Is the BMW worth the extra $20,000 to $50,000? It’s a tough question to answer. Camissa said one could buy a Tesla Model 3 Performance and a Mazda Miata for the same price as a single BMW M3, which things into perspective.

Mercedes has taken things one step further and put the brakes inside the housing of an electric vehicle’s drive unit, and it’s touting multiple advantages, including never having to service the brakes for the lifetime of the car.</p>, <p>Electric vehicles can use their motors to slow down, not only saving their friction brakes from wear but also putting electricity into their battery pack. Various companies have proposed different types of brakes for EVs, from Continental’s ultra-thick mountain bike-like disks to the drum brakes that Volkswagen equips all vehicles built on its <a>MEB platform</a>, like <a>the ID.4</a> or <a>Audi Q4 E-Tron</a>.</p>, <p>VW argues that even in its EVs with over 300 horsepower, drum brakes are sufficient for the rear. Most of the braking is done by the front brakes anyway, so going back to this older style of brakes (which is cheaper than disk brakes) is one way VW has adapted its vehicles for electric propulsion.</p>, <p>Mercedes has now taken this one step further with its in-drive brakes. However, it hasn’t simply taken a traditional disk or drum brake setup and put it inside the drive unit. It completely reimagined braking, and in the version of the system they showed us in Stuttgart last week, the disk is water-cooled and it doesn’t spin, and the brake pad is circular and it spins with the motor.</p>, <p>There is no traditional caliper either and scrubbing speed is achieved by pushing the circular brake pad onto the stationary disk. <a>Mercedes</a> says this system shouldn’t require service for <a>the lifetime of the vehicle</a> and all the brake dust it generates is kept inside the system in a compartment that doesn’t need to be emptied.</p>, <p><a>The upcoming Euro 7 (EU7) emissions standard</a> doesn’t just look at tailpipe emissions. It also takes tire and brake particulate emissions from vehicles into account, so keeping brake dust from going into the environment will become more of a talking point in Europe once EU7 comes into force in 2026.</p>, <p>More Mercedes EV Stories</p>, <p>This seems like a big departure even from the inboard brakes that we already know. Mercedes argues there are plenty of advantages aside from the system being “virtually maintenance-free.” Since the disk is water-cooled, brake fade under heavy use shouldn’t be an issue. It also reduces unsprung weight, which improves handling.</p>, <p>Another advantage touted by the manufacturer is being able to equip vehicles with completely covered, aerodynamic wheels that will help lower vehicles’ drag coefficient. The system would also reduce braking noise, and owners wouldn’t be met with rust-covered brake disks after not driving their cars for a few days.</p>, <p>We didn’t think this was such a big issue, but Mercedes told us this specifically was something it got many complaints about. The Mercedes engineer who explained how this new braking system works said removing the caliper from the wheel will give designers even more freedom to create unique-looking wheels, but it will be hard to convince car enthusiasts that this is an advantage.</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Mercedes Wants EV Battery Packs With Both NMC And LFP Cells</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

Among the many innovations we were shown at the event called Mercedes Future Experience was a new type of power converter that allows for much more control over a battery pack than ever before.</p>, <p>Its programmable micro-converter can be wirelessly controlled and embedded into the battery pack and controlled wirelessly. This allows for control on an individual cell pair, allowing for much finer adjustment of the charge that goes into each one. For this system to work, the cells need to be connected in parallel, not in series, which unlocks new possibilities.</p>, <p>For instance, a vehicle with this system could balance the charge in its cells far better than today’s EVs. It could detect and isolate damaged cells without affecting the entire battery pack, and it would also allow for a much more accurate battery health check, which would easily be able to pinpoint problem cells and check their individual parameters.</p>, <p>This new type of micro-converter can also keep the total battery pack voltage constant regardless of the state of charge. It typically varies with the state of charge.</p>, <p><a>Mercedes</a> explains that “research results show it is possible to provide a constant HV output of <a>800 volts</a>, regardless of the state of charge and the state of health of the individual cells. The output voltage of this vehicle battery is no longer dependent on the number of cells connected in series. The number is determined purely by the desired performance and capacity class.”</p>, <p>If this makes it into production, it would also allow for much more modular battery packs than what we have in today’s EVs, resulting in more efficient use of space. It could help automakers cut costs by applying increased standardization and modularization when applied on a large scale.</p>, <p>More EV Battery Stories</p>, <p>During a round table talk with Mercedes’ Chief Technology Officer Markus Schäfer, we asked about the possibility of using multiple chemistries within the same battery pack, specifically both <a>LFP</a> and NMC cells. Schäfer told us “Yes, this is exactly the idea, to mix and match,” and he confirmed that the possibility of an LFP and NMC pack is in the cards. He did not say when we could see such a pack in a production car given that this innovation is still in the very early stages of testing.</p>, <p>LFP (short for lithium iron phosphate) batteries can better take regular fast charging all the way to 100%, exhibiting less degradation than NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) batteries. They also have better thermal stability and are more affordable. However, NMC batteries can store more current and are preferred for large-capacity battery packs that power <a>long-range EVs</a>. Having both in the same battery pack would have multiple advantages, taking advantage of both their strengths.</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Mercedes Reinvents Brakes For EVs, Puts Them Inside The Drive Unit</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

It was a surprising pairing, as Trump has long criticized electric vehicles, the primary thing Musk's biggest company makes. Trump has <a>promised to get rid of the federal clean vehicle incentive for consumers</a>, which <a>Musk says will ultimately help Tesla</a>. But if Trump delivers on another promise—rolling back emissions standards for other automakers—it may hurt another key Tesla revenue stream.</p>, <p>Tesla earned $2.1 billion by selling regulatory credits to other automakers in the first three quarters of 2024, according to <a>reporting from <em>The New York Times</em></a> based on the company's regulatory filings. That accounts for 43% of the automaker's—er... \"A.I. company's\"—profit.</p>, <p>These credits have long been a big part of Tesla's business. U.S. and other government standards require automakers to hit fleet-wide emissions targets. Companies that are above those targets must buy credits to bring down their average. They buy credits from companies like Tesla, which only makes zero-emissions vehicles, and other brands that are more efficient than required by law. This incentivizes companies to beat their targets, as it opens up a valuable revenue stream, while still providing leeway for those that can't or don't want to sell more efficient vehicles. </p>, <p>The credit-selling business was even more crucial to Tesla earlier on. Back when other automakers were struggling to get their EV programs off the ground, and Tesla was losing money on most cars it made, profit from regulatory credits was a lifeline. Many have argued it would have never survived without them.</p>, <p>But in hitching his wagon to Trump's, Musk has gambled that Tesla no longer needs government incentives for consumer purchases, or for its EV and battery factories or to drive its regulatory credit business. Musk has long said that Tesla is not a car company, and that its future ambitions lie in autonomy and A.I. For those who like Tesla for the cars, however, the CEO's increasing focus on A.I. and politics is disconcerting. After all, Tesla is a company that primarily builds cars, and one that would not exist today without a series of manufacturing incentives, consumer incentives and regulatory schemes that all helped it cross \"the valley of death\" that dooms many start-ups. </p>, <p>Despite supposedly being in it for the altruistic purpose of transitioning the whole world to sustainable energy, it sure looks like Musk is trying to pull up the ladder behind him. That's not a great look. But when you haven't stepped off the ladder yourself, it could be quite dangerous, too.</p>, <p><em>Contact the author: <a>Mack.hogan@insideevs.com</a>. </em></p>, <p>Related Stories</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Over 50% Of The World's Drivers Expect To Have An EV In The Next 10 Years</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

The covered vehicles have an issue with their Integrated Charging Control Units (ICCUs), which is responsible for charging the low-voltage 12-volt battery using power from the high-voltage system. The ICCU is a common failure point on Hyundai, Genesis and Kia EVs on the E-GMP platform, and if it fails it'll stop charging the 12-volt battery. The 12-volt going flat can lead to a loss of drive power, causing the car to suddenly lose power and speed.

It wouldn't want to. But VW's service network is a far more interesting proposition, as scaling service has proved troublesome for Rivian and fellow direct-to-consumer automaker Tesla. Unfortunately, using VW service centers is probably not going to be possible in the U.S. Scaringe told reporters that dealers have made that almost impossible.</p>, <p>\"Unfortunately, in the United States it's not an easy question. We have this horrific state-by-state level of rules that are as close as you can get to corruption,\" Scaringe told <a>InsideEVs</a> and other reporters during a roundtable.</p>, <p>\"I think you essentially have, like, lots of dealers have paid for laws that make it really hard for us to interact directly with the consumer,\" he continued.  </p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: 2025 Rivian R1S First Drive            </h2>, <p>Many states have protections for car dealers codified into law. They broadly protect dealers from having to directly compete with manufacturers, but how those rules are interpreted and applied varies wildly. In Tesla's home state, Texas, <a>the company cannot sell cars out of company stores</a>. Instead, it must sell cars online, and can deliver them at \"service centers.\" Rivian's space in Seattle is similar, as in Washington the company's representatives cannot talk about pricing or take orders.</p>, <p>These laws were—in most cases—designed to protect dealerships from their own manufacturers selling direct-to-consumer, cutting out the middle man and outcompeting them on cost. But they are now stifling brands that don't have dealerships to compete with. There's no AutoNation Rivian or Penkse Tesla losing business when these companies sell in Texas or Washington. There's no option at all if you, as a consumer, <a>want to buy a Tesla and take delivery in Louisiana</a>. So these laws are effectively protecting dealers of other brands from legitimate competition with new brands. </p>, <p>Related Stories</p>, <p>The states with the strongest laws protecting dealers tend to have extremely large and powerful car dealer lobbies, which wine, dine and donate to local politicians to make sure they have plenty of friends in state government. These friendly relationships tend to correlate with laws that make sure it is nearly impossible to buy a car without including a dealer in the transaction. It's not hard to see why Scaringe says this is essentially \"corruption.\" They're spending vast sums lobbying and being rewarded with laws that restrict consumer choice and competition while protecting their profits.</p>, <p>Because the laws are different in every state, you have to grease a lot of wheels to get the train moving. There are still states where it is illegal to sell Rivians or Teslas directly. And there are many states where <a>dealers plan to challenge Volkswagen's plan to launch Scout Motors with a direct-to-consumer model</a>, a la Tesla. If even one challenge in a major market succeeds, it may mess up the whole plan. Because while it's hard enough to sell vehicles directly to consumers, it gets a lot harder if you also have franchises operating as official sales and service locations. </p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: Rivian R2            </h2>, <p>All of the issues Rivian faces with its direct-to-consumer push \"become exacerbated if we were to use a mixed model\" where they have directly owned and franchise service centers, Scaringe says. So it's likely not possible to use VW dealers for service, even if VW was cool for it. But the CEO is still clear-eyed that expanding service options needs to be a priority, and not just doing service where you sell cars.</p>, <p>\"You don't need 5,000 retail locations in the United States to sell three or four million cars a year. Tesla's a good example. [Its] number of retail locations per sale is far, far lower than any of the incumbents. But you do need a lot of service infrastructure,\" he said. </p>, <p>The vehicle's ability to diagnose and report its own problems will help improve service efficiency, as will Rivian's ability to do most service in your driveway. Over half of the company's current service visits are handled by its mobile service arm. But the fact is that the service infrastructure needs to grow, regardless of how difficult it is to navigate the U.S.' state-by-state restrictions. </p>, <p>\"We have a service backlog where we're trying to build as much service infrastructure as fast as we can. But in some markets, the product scaling has happened faster than we can build out service infrastructure,\" Scaringe said. \"That's a short-term anomaly. Long term, we think in the United States we're going to a build a really robust service infrastructure. In Europe, the question is—we'll do sales on our own—but whether we partner with somebody on service. It's certainly an opportunity.\"</p>, <p>If Rivian needs a service partner in Europe, I know a company in Wolfsburg it could probably call.</p>, <p>Contact the author: <a>Mack.hogan@insideevs.com</a>. </p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>The Rivian R2 And R3 Probably Won't Be 800-Volt</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

The company said in its Chapter 11 petition filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas that its “liquidity picture has become dire.”</p>, <p>Northvolt, which has operations in California, has roughly $30 million in cash, which is enough to support it for only about a week. Meanwhile, it has $5.8 billion in debt. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will enable it to continue operations at a reduced scale and pay employees. The battery maker has also secured a $100 million loan from truck maker Scania, its biggest customer and one of the shareholders. Northvolt said the new loan is part of $245 million in financing support for the bankruptcy.</p>, <p>The restructuring process is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. Northvolt Ett, the battery maker’s <a>flagship gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden</a>, and Northvolt Labs in Västerås, Sweden will remain operational during the restructuring process. <a>Northvolt Germany</a> and Northvolt North America, subsidiaries of Northvolt AB with projects in Germany and <a>Canada</a>, are financed separately and will continue to operate as usual outside of the Chapter 11 process, the company said.</p>, <p>More Battery Manufacturing Stories</p>, <p>“This decisive step will allow Northvolt to continue its mission to establish a homegrown, European industrial base for battery production,” said Tom Johnstone, interim Chairman of the Board. “Despite near-term challenges, this action to strengthen our capital structure will allow us to capture the continued market demand for vehicle electrification. We are likewise pleased by the strong support we have received from our existing lenders and our customers.”</p>, <p>Northvolt manufactures lithium-ion battery cells used for electric vehicles and stationary storage. <a>Volkswagen Group is its largest shareholder</a> after an investment of roughly $1 billion. <a>BMW Group was also briefly part of the investment group</a>, pledging to pay $2 billion, but the deal fell through after BMW claimed Northvolt failed to deliver batteries on time.</p>, <p>The Swedish battery maker has two fully functional factories, one in Sweden and the other in Poland. Several other facilities are planned. The first customer deliveries were made in 2022, with the main factory in Sweden reportedly capable of producing 60 gigawatt-hours worth of batteries per year, enough for 1 million EVs.

        "html": "[<p>Chime in with article commenting.</p>, <h1>'It Would Just Be Dumb': Kia Exec On Plan To Kill EV Tax Credit</h1>, <h2>\n                “You’re pulling the rug out from under the whole industry,” Kia America COO Steve Center told InsideEVs on Thursday.             </h2>, <p>As Kia and its parent company the Hyundai Motor Group plan an onslaught of new U.S.-made electric vehicles aimed at winning American converts, the potential threat of losing the electric vehicle tax credits is like a dark cloud hanging over everything. But one senior Kia executive at the LA Auto Show said what the rest of the auto industry is all but certainly thinking right now: President-elect <a>Donald Trump’s plan to kill the EV tax credit</a> would be disruptive to jobs and the trajectory of the entire American car business. </p>, <p>“It would just be dumb,” Kia America COO and Executive Vice President Steve Center told <a>InsideEVs</a> in an interview on Thursday. “[The government has] steered the industry in a direction, and I think you need to allow the industry to recover its investments and then let it float.”</p>, <p>The South Korean automaker has invested heavily to bring manufacturing of its <a>EV6</a> and <a>EV9</a> electric models to Georgia, in part to comply with the $7,500 purchase incentive’s North American assembly requirement. It’s adjusted supply chains to meet restrictions around battery and component sourcing for qualifying vehicles. While current Kias aren’t eligible, some upcoming 2025 models built in the U.S. should be. The same is true at Kia's corporate cousin Hyundai, which is aiming to entice American buyers to go electric with U.S.-made cars like the <a>Ioniq 5</a> and new <a>Ioniq 9</a>. </p>, <p>The 2025 Kia EV6 GT</p>, <p>Now Hyundai Motor Group and other carmakers are staring down a future where massive investments in EV models and domestic EV manufacturing are worth less. Various analyses have found that <a>U.S. demand for electric cars would drop</a> without the incentive; the same has happened in places like Europe as well. That would be disruptive to an industry that's invested a lot of money and long-term plans into electrification, Center said. </p>, <p>“You’re pulling the rug out from under the whole industry. And quite frankly, it isn’t just Kia and the import brands,” he said. “A lot of other companies have spent a lot of money trying to comply with the regulations.”</p>, <p>He said the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate law that included the latest revision to the EV tax credits, has <a>created jobs</a> and supported the environment. </p>, <p>“It’s just bad policy to keep changing. So you don’t like it? Pick on something else you don’t like that isn’t going to hurt the biggest industry in the country,” Center said. </p>, <p>Kia EV9 GT</p>, <p><em>Reuters</em> this month <a>reported</a> that the Trump transition team is drawing up plans to eliminate the credit as part of broader tax reform, <a>sending shockwaves</a> through the EV industry. The provision aims to drum up demand for battery-powered cars and also to wean the U.S. auto industry off of Chinese battery supply chains.</p>, <p>Trump <a>would need Congress</a>, which now has a Republican majority, to cooperate here. But it’s still yet to be seen whether the plan will withstand pressure from the auto industry and from lawmakers whose constituents benefit from new EV factories and jobs. It’s also unclear whether Trump plans to attack the commercial clean-vehicle credit, which <a>subsidizes EV leases</a>. </p>, <p>The End Of The EV Tax Credit?</p>, <p>Following the <em>Reuters</em> report, the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group representing EV and battery companies, released <a>a statement</a> defending the policy. “If the U.S. is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal—like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit—aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,” said Albert Gore, the group’s executive director. </p>, <p>The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto industry’s largest lobbying group, urged Congress in October to keep IRA policies intact so its members can stay competitive with China as the global car market electrifies. </p>, <p>The change in policy could deal a blow to EV sales, Center said. But at the same time, it’s not a doomsday scenario.</p>, <p>“It’s bad. It will hurt. Is it going to kill everything? I don’t think so, because people are buying these cars, and they’re leasing these cars,” he said. “It’s a sweetener. It aids mass adoption.”</p>, <p>Kia EV9 GT</p>, <p>At the moment, Kia doesn’t sell any vehicles that qualify for the full buying credit, though it plans to. Building the <a>EV9</a> and <a>EV6</a> in the U.S. should help it get there. <span>Its customers can benefit from the $7,500 leasing incentive, which doesn’t enforce eligibility or manufacturing requirements for vehicles. </span></p>, <p>Getting rid of the EV purchase incentive may not have a huge impact in part because of the policy’s household income requirements, Center said. Plus, <a>charging infrastructure</a> is still the main barrier to adoption, in his view. </p>, <p>He said that if the administration kills the tax credit, they should at least do so gradually. “It’s messed up,” Center said. “But I would say if you must eliminate it, have a ramp down.”</p>, <p><em>Contact the author: <a>tim.levin@insideevs.com</a> </em></p>, <p>More Kia News</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Hyundai, Kia Recall Over 200,000 EVs Because They Might Lose Power While Driving</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

We’ve seen all possible parts of a car teased and even car brand revamps presented like they were fashion shows, but now DS is blanking out words in the press release for a new model.</p>, <p>Its upcoming posh tall fastback EV will have a claimed WLTP range of 466 miles (750 km)... and other features that we can only guess by the length of the word.</p>, <p>The thing about the press release is that the blacked-out words look like an afterthought, not a marketing department’s brilliant idea to create hype in a new way—it looks like they decided to conceal these things at the last moment. What could <a>DS</a> be hiding in between the vehicle’s matrix LED lights, and what could they be framing that it needed to be redacted?</p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: DS Electric Crossover teaser            </h2>, <p>Not that the upcoming crossover, which may be called the DS8, isn’t cool. The teaser shots show a lightly camouflaged prototype wearing its production body, sporting aggressive fascias and a very dramatic roofline. Its boomerang-like front and rear light clusters define the corners of the car in a similar way to how Cadillac does it in its latest models.</p>, <p>The upcoming DS8 is the production version of <a>the DS Aero Sport Lounge concept</a> unveiled back in 2020 when it was touted as turning travel into art. Even though it’s a high-riding vehicle, DS still touts a 0.24 drag coefficient, which goes some way toward explaining the range advantage it has over other vehicles built on the Stellantis STLA Medium platform.</p>, <p>It will likely get the same 96.9 kWh (usable) battery as other related models, like <a>the Peugeot 3008 EV</a>, whose range rating in Europe is 434 miles (700 km), or 32 miles (50 km) less. Charging from 20 to 80% takes the Peugeot 27 minutes, and 93 miles (150 km) can be added in 10 minutes.</p>, <p>More On This</p>, <p>You can’t get the electric Peugeot 3008 with the long-range battery and all-wheel drive. The big-battery model is only available in single-motor configuration with 227 horsepower. The 321 hp dual-motor 3008 has a smaller 73 kWh battery. This means that DS has either found a way of pairing the dual-motor setup with the big battery or the DS8 will be front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>DS announced a few years ago that it was only going to launch pure-electric vehicles after 2024. However, in light of <a>recent trends shown by the EV market</a>, DS could switch back to combustion given that the STLA Medium platform can also take combustion powertrains with all levels of electrification (mild hybrid, hybrid and plug-in hybrid), so we can’t rule that out—Peugeot offers the 3008 and 5008 as plug-in hybrids.</p>, <p>The manufacturer says it will reveal more about the upcoming model before the end of the year. We really hope to learn what it is that the driver’s seat provides that we were not ready to see yet.</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>2022 DS3 E-Tense Facelift Debuts With Shorter Name, More Power And Range</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

        "html": "[<p>Chime in with article commenting.</p>, <h1>The Rivian R2 And R3 Probably Won't Be 800-Volt</h1>, <h2>\n                Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told reporters that the company can deliver competitive charge times on a 400-volt system.            </h2>, <p>Rivian has not yet announced whether its forthcoming R2 and R3 midsize cars will use a 400-volt architecture or a more expensive 800- or 900-volt system. Fans may be hoping that the next generation of products will move to a higher-voltage architecture, which typically can allow for faster charging and more efficiency. But after sitting down with Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, I don't think that's likely.</p>, <p>In a roundtable with reporters, Scaringe said that while there are benefits to going 800-volt, they're more important for bigger batteries. Larger packs—like those in the R1—are more likely to be voltage-constrained. But with a smaller pack like we're expecting to see in the R2 and R3, Scaringe says battery chemistry is a bigger limiter than voltage.  </p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: Rivian R2            </h2>, <p>In the R2, the move is \"just not as critical,\" he said. \"R2 we've optimized more around cost, to make sure we deliver great performance but [at] these price points. I don't think it's as important in a smaller vehicle.</p>, <p>He stopped short of confirming directly that the products would be on a 400-volt architecture, but he sounded quite convinced that an 800-volt system wasn't necessary for R2 or R3. The larger R1 will \"need to transition\" to an 800- or 900-volt setup, he said, but didn't say when. Such a substantial change is unlikely until the vehicle's next redesign.</p>, <p>Hyundai, Kia, Lucid and Porsche have all been bullish on 800- or 900-volt architectures. Their cars show why the technology is appealing: A relatively affordable Hyundai Ioniq 6 can zip from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes. A Porsche Taycan can do it in 16. That's blazing fast. But Scaringe says that the focus on voltage is misplaced. While an 800-volt pack can deliver charging speeds of 350 kW or higher, in most smaller or mid-size vehicles the voltage isn't the limiter.  </p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: Rivian R3            </h2>, <p>\"We think ultimately the charge times need to be sub-20 minutes for that 10-80 time. We're 100% aligned on that. You can get there with [400v],\" he said. A 450-volt charger running at 500 amps can deliver 225 kW. If a car with a sub-100-kWh pack could sustain those speeds, it'd be capable of doing 10-80% in 20 minutes. Look no further than Hyundai for proof. Despite its 800-volt architecture, a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Ioniq 6 will \"only\" peak around 220-230 kW. Some 400-volt cars like the Tesla Model 3 and Rivian R1 can hit similar numbers. The Hyundais just hold higher speeds for longer, allowing for those ultra-fast charge times.</p>, <p>But that shows that the voltage isn't really the problem. Many existing battery packs just cannot accept that much energy for long enough to deliver those sorts of times. An 800-volt system would probably help, but cell chemistry and battery cooling is more important, Scaringe says. He didn't mention it, but the implication is that its \"4695\" cylindrical sells the company plans to use in the R2 and R3 should have better thermals than existing batteries.  </p>, <p>We'll see if they're good enough to hit the sub-20-minute charge time goal. Right now, Rivian has only claimed that the R2 and R3 will be able to do a 10-80% charge in \"under 30 minutes.\" Getting to a sub-20 time is a much tougher challenge. Given that Scaringe noted it as a long-term goal rather than a promise, there's no word on whether the R2 or R3 will get there. If they do, though, it likely won't be with the help of an 800-volt architecture.</p>, <p>Contact the author: <a>Mack.hogan@insideevs.com</a>. </p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>2026 Rivian R2 Will Get New LG Cells With 'Six Times' The Capacity</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

If you ask the Tesla owners who will soon share their beloved Supercharger stations with Kia drivers and many others, that's the right side to have it on. </p>, <p>That update comes as part of a wider refresh to the <a>EV6</a> that broke cover on Thursday. The 2025 model gets a new mug, more range and, perhaps most importantly, a Tesla-style charging port built right in. Thanks to an integrated North American Charging Standard (NACS) port, the EV6 will soon be able to charge up at thousands of <a>Tesla Superchargers</a> without using a dongle of any kind. That access opens up in January. </p>, <p>Read Up On The NACS Transition</p>, <p>But simply <a>working with Tesla to grant Supercharger access</a> (they used to be reserved for Tesla owners only, but that's gradually changing) doesn't guarantee the charging process at those locations will easy or hiccup-free. Since Tesla began letting outsiders use its stations, it's become clear that the location of a car's charging port can make or break the charging experience—both for the car's owner and the station's other patrons. </p>, <p>2025 Kia EV6</p>, <p>Supercharger stalls are <a>designed with short cords</a> and for Teslas only, and all Teslas have their charging port at the back left of the vehicle. So when a non-Tesla shows up with its port in the \"wrong\" place, the owner can't simply back into the appropriate spot like a Model Y or Model 3 could. They may have to straddle two parking spaces or park horizontally across them just to get the cord to reach.</p>, <p>Understandably, that's been <a>pissing off Tesla owners left and right</a>. It's awkward for the person causing the nuisance too. </p>, <p>2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line.</p>, <p>Enter Kia. The brand not only gave the 2025 EV6 a NACS port—it also relocated the port the left rear fender to mimic Tesla's setup. (The high-performance EV6 GT won't get the same update, however.) Kia didn't explicitly mention the parking problem in its press release, only saying that the new port and location serve to \"make charging more convenient.\" </p>, <p>But everybody knows this is an issue, including Tesla. <a>On its website</a>, it recommends that non-Tesla owners \"avoid parking diagonally to reach the cable and try to obstruct as few charge posts as possible,\" and shows how they should do so in a handy illustration. </p>, <p>\"Additionally, we encourage all vehicle manufacturers to standardize charge port locations to the rear driver side or front passenger side,\" Tesla adds. </p>, <p>This may only be a temporary bug of the great NACS transition, though. Gas stations have no problem dealing with cars that have their gas caps on either side of the vehicle. We're starting to see EV charging stations with that kind of <a>pull-through design coming online</a> too.

Oh, you may act like you hate the anachronistic idea of changing \"gears\" in a car that technically only has a one-speed transmission because it ruins the \"purity\" of the smooth and efficient EV experience.

Find some joy in your life for once.</p>, <p>2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line European Spec Photos, Runaway Red</p>, <p>And joy will definitely be on order with the new 2025 Kia EV6 GT. The U.S.-spec version of Kia's updated crossover made its debut today at the LA Auto Show. And while there's still a lot we don't know about it, we have power specs and one key detail: the EV6 GT now gets a simulated gear shift feature.</p>, <p>\"The GT’s new Virtual Gear Shift feature enhances driving immersion by simulating gear shifts with visuals, engine sound effects, and a tactile sensation through motor torque adjustments,\" Kia officials said in a news release. And that's all they have to say for now, but we'll try and get more at the show itself if we can. </p>, <p>Since Kia and Hyundai are owned by the same parent company but are technically separate entities, the news release does not mention the Ioniq 5 N. Yet it's clear that something similar will now be added to the Ioniq 5's platform-mate, the EV6. And on the Hyundai, the \"N e-Shift\" feature really goes the distance.</p>, <p>2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N First Drive Review</p>, <p>That car simulates an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission using the paddles normally used to adjust regenerative braking intensity on other Hyundai Motor Group cars. When activated—and it has a normal \"drive\" setting as any DCT would—it works much the same way: left paddle to go down a \"gear,\" right to go up. Of course, the EVs do not have multiple forward gears. They have so much instant torque that gears are not necessary to achieve different speeds as they would be on a gas engine, which puts power to the wheels far less efficiently. </p>, <p>But the Ioniq 5 N is also special for how it simulates the \"feel\" of gear shifting, including the jolt and brief interruption in power that happens and the mechanical resistance that's normal upon downshifting. The Ioniq 5 N also simulates engine sounds through the speakers, will let you rev the \"engine\" while parked and has a \"redline\" you'll hit before you need to shift again. It's all great fun.</p>, <p>2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line European Spec Photos, Runaway Red</p>, <p>Based on Kia's statement, we can expect some version of that for the EV6, but I'm eager to see Kia's spin on things. I'm sure engineers will find some way to make it fairly unique to this car.</p>, <p>Beyond that, we know a few other specs, including power. The GT delivers 601 hp and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, up from 576 hp before. With GT Mode activated, you get a full 641 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque. Unlike the rest of the EV6 line, the GT will still be made in South Korea, not Kia's Georgia factory, so it won't qualify for U.S. EV tax credits at purchase. Pricing has not been released yet, nor have official photos: what you see above is the European-spec Kia EV6 GT-Line, which is visually similar. </p>, <p>So now we're all wondering the same thing, right? The new Kia EV6 GT, or the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N? We have reason to believe the Kia is a hotted-up version of the existing model with a ton of extra power and some new tricks, while the Hyundai is a top-to-bottom performance car rework that's meant for track day duty. But the EV6 GT may still be no slouch. This a showdown we'll have to take to the track in 2025 so we can find out. </p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: 2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line (European Spec)            </h2>, <p><em>Contact the author: <a>patrick.george@insideevs.com</a></em></p>, <p>More EV6 News</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Hyundai, Kia Recall Over 200,000 EVs Because They Might Lose Power While Driving</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

        "html": "[<p>Chime in with article commenting.</p>, <h1>2026 Kia EV9 GT: Sporty Electric SUV With Native Tesla NACS Port, Virtual Gear Shifts</h1>, <h2>\n                Meet Kia’s most powerful three-row SUV. It just happens to be electric.            </h2>, <p>This is the all-new 2026 Kia EV9 GT. Not to be confused with the <a>EV9 GT-Line</a> which was already available with some sporty-looking hardware, the newly introduced version is <a>Kia</a>’s most powerful production three-row SUV.</p>, <p>Boasting a dual-motor powertrain with a total estimated output of 510 horsepower, the Kia EV9 GT is 122 hp more powerful than the EV9 GT-Line. That’s enough to propel the sporty electric family hauler from zero to 60 miles per hour in an estimated 4.3 seconds, seven-tenths of a second quicker than the GT-Line.</p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: 2026 Kia EV9 GT            </h2>, <p>The front motor of the EV9 GT makes 214 hp while the rear drive unit pumps out 362 hp, but because they don’t reach peak power at the same time, you can’t just add the numbers together. The torque figure was not disclosed by the Korean automaker.</p>, <p>More Kia Stories</p>, <p>Kia’s go-fast family hauler adopts a rather controversial feature from the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N–Virtual Gear Shifts. We quite liked <a>the simulated gear shifts</a> when we drove the refreshed Ioniq 5 N, but there are plenty of people out there who think an EV–which doesn’t actually have gears–shouldn’t try to impersonate a gas-powered car. This includes <a>some folks at Porsche</a> who said such a feature will only make their cars worse. </p>, <p>The system works in conjunction with the in-cabin electric Active Sound Design (e-ASD) system to make it feel like the car shifts through gears while accelerating. The EV jolts when it goes from one virtual gear to another and the sound system provides the audio cues to tie it all together.</p>, <p>The EV9 GT is Kia’s first three-row SUV to get electronically controlled suspension or ECS. This can soften or harden the suspension damping based on what driving mode has been selected: Normal, Eco, Sport or My Drive. These modes also alter the steering and brake feel. Speaking of brakes, the flagship EV9 gets larger front rotors than the lesser versions.</p>, <p>At the rear, there’s an electronic limited-slip differential (e-LSD), just like on the <a>EV6 GT</a>, which limits wheelspin to the tires with less grip. Meanwhile, the 7.8-inch ground clearance is the same as on the other trim levels, as is the 5,000-pound maximum towing capacity of the GT-Line.</p>, <p>Just like the new <a>Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a>Genesis Electrified GV70</a> and <a>Hyundai Ioniq 9</a>, the 2026 Kia EV9 GT comes with <a>Tesla</a>’s NACS charging port from the factory. This means owners will be able to charge at Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network without an adapter. However, an adapter will be needed to charge at DC fast chargers with CCS plugs, like the vast majority of stalls operated by companies like EVgo, <a>Electrify America</a> and ChargePoint.</p>, <p>Kia said that all <a>EV9</a> versions will come as standard with the NACS charging port starting in the first half of next year. The battery of the EV9 GT is the same as on the other long-range versions–99.8 kilowatt-hours–but the automaker hasn’t provided a range rating or a maximum charging speed. For reference, the EV9 GT-Line has an EPA-rated range of 270 miles and can accept up to 235 kW from a DC fast charger, enough for a 10% to 80% top-up in less than 25 minutes.</p>, <p>“The EV9 has been a home run for Kia and introduced the first mass-market electric three-row SUV,” said Steven Center, COO &amp; EVP, Kia America. “And EV9 GT includes all those wonderful elements while amping up the fun factor significantly. This new halo trim is set to spark the hearts of driving enthusiasts who still need the practicality of a six-passenger SUV. You can have your cake and eat it too!”</p>, <p>Outside, the 2026 Kia comes with 21-inch wheels wrapped in 285/45R21 high-performance Continental tires. The brake calipers are painted in neon green and GT-exclusive patterns on the Active Air Flaps in front.</p>, <p>Inside, the cabin is adorned with bright green accents, including on the steering wheel and seats, both of which are unique to the EV9 GT. The standard kit includes Parking Collision Assist with front, side and rear monitoring, as well as Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Navigation-based Smart Cruise Control and others.</p>, <p>Pricing for the 2026 Kia EV9 GT has not been announced yet. However, we know it will go on sale in the latter half of next year. We also know that it will be assembled in South Korea, so any potential federal tax credit when purchasing goes out the window (leasing might make it eligible for a tax credit, if there will still be a tax credit for EVs in 2025.)</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Kia EV9 U.S. Production Slows Amid Stricter IRA Rules</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

        "html": "[<p>Chime in with article commenting.</p>, <h1>2025 Kia EV6: Made In America With A Tesla NACS Plug, Bigger Battery</h1>, <h2>\n                Kia's groundbreaking EV6 makes a big comeback for 2025. The new face isn't even the big story here.            </h2>, <p>The <a>Hyundai Ioniq 5</a> gets a lot of well-deserved glory in the electric vehicle space. But personally, I'm more a fan of its cousin, the <a>Kia EV6</a>. So much so that I <a>bought one earlier this year</a> and am strongly considering acquiring it outright whenever my lease is up. But when I look at the changes coming with the updated 2025 Kia EV6, I may just have to consider an upgrade.</p>, <p>What's better now about Kia's electric crossover? Basically, everything. The EV6 will now be built in the U.S. to qualify for at least some EV tax credits; packs more range thanks to a bigger battery; offers a redesigned face and interior; and will come out of the gate with a newly-relocated Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and access to that vast network of DC fast-chargers.</p>, <p>There's a lot to cover here, so let's dig in.</p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: 2025 Kia EV6            </h2>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>Range And Power</h2>, <p>The EV6 originally debuted way back in 2021 and now sees its most substantive update yet. We've already seen its newly redesigned face—a \"Star Map\" grille designed to more closely match other modern Kia offerings—as <a>the second-generation model</a> has been on sale for a few months in places like Europe and its native South Korea. But the U.S.-spec version comes with more surprises than we anticipated.</p>, <p>The EV6 now gets two battery options in larger sizes than the previous car, offering more range. The base, smaller battery is now 63 kilowatt-hours in size, up from 58 kWh previously, while the larger battery goes from 77.4 kWh to 84 kWh. While exact range figures for each trim level have not been released, Kia claims the Light, Long-Range, Wind and GT-Line models will target 319 miles of range in rear-wheel-drive configuration.</p>, <p>2025 Kia EV6</p>, <p>There's no word yet on range for the dual-motor all-wheel-drive models, unfortunately. But we're expecting all range figures to be generally similar to the 2025 Ioniq 5 that uses the same battery setups, so likely around 290 or more miles of range for the AWD versions. Either way, those should be decent upgrades from the current EV6; the RWD models are currently listed at 310 miles of EPA-rated range and 282 for AWD models (which drops to 252 and 218 miles for the GT-Line and GT variants, respectively.) Considering that my own EV6 Wind AWD regularly tops 300 miles of range on a 100% charge when the weather is fair, those could be much more consistently above that. </p>, <p>Power is roughly similar across the board, however. The Light RWD model is rated at 167 hp and 258 lb.-ft. of torque, while more powerful RWD models in Light, Long-Range, Wind and GT-Line forms come in at 225 hp and 258 lb.-ft. of torque. Upgrading to AWD gets you 320 hp and 446 lb.-ft. of torque as before.</p>, <p>But I'm happy to say the go-fast <a>Kia EV6 GT</a> gets even more powerful now, which it absolutely didn't need, but nobody's going to say no to more power. The GT delivers 601 hp and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, up from 576 hp before. Turn on GT Mode and you get a full 641 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque to adequately meet any Lamborghini-hunting needs that may arise in your community. </p>, <p>2025 Kia EV6</p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>New Design, New Tech, New Plug</h2>, <p>I'll readily admit I'm not the biggest fan of the updated grille. But the EV6 still looks as sharp as ever, and it offers more than just a new face here. The taillights also add Star Map details, while the front and rear bumper have new designs with sharper angles and a more aggressive overall stance. Kia's also offering new designs for its 19- to 21-inch wheels. </p>, <p>2025 Kia EV6</p>, <p>The inside is pretty familiar but with a few notable tweaks. The steering wheel has been totally redesigned, and the EV6 finally gets the fully updated Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) operating system that offers quicker speeds, higher-definiton graphics, and over-the-air (OTA) updates—something the current EV6 has only done with navigation and a handful of other core features. Basically, the software setup on the EV6 <a>now mirrors that of the EV9</a>, which gets high marks from us. And like the EV9, you now get access to the new Kia Connect Store for downloads like displays themed after your favorite NBA teams. (Yes, really.) The Digital Key setup has been improved to offer true smartphone-activated door unlocking, remote starting and driving.</p>, <p>And finally, the flush door handles now pop open automatically across all trim levels. That fixes one of my biggest gripes about the current EV6 and may justify an upgrade on that alone. </p>, <p>Kia's unfortunately not telling us much about the EV6's legendary fast-charging. The car can go from a 10% charge to 80% in just about 18 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast-charger, and we don't expect that to change. However, like the <a>Hyundai Ioniq 9</a> and updated <a>Genesis Electrified GV70</a> that also debuted at the LA Auto Show this week, the revised EV6 packs a NACS plug from the factory now. And it's been moved to the other side of the car—the driver's side instead of the passenger's—to make charging at Tesla's Supercharger stations a little easier. </p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>What Now?</h2>, <p>2025 Kia EV6</p>, <p>And best of all, the revised EV6 is now American-made, just like the 2025 Ioniq 5. This one is made at Kia's West Point, Georgia assembly plant alongside the EV9, so it should qualify for at least some of the $7,500 EV tax credits when purchased. <a>Those may soon vanish</a>, so take advantage of them while you can. (The EV6 GT will continue to be built in Korea.) </p>, <p>Kia says that like the outgoing car, the 2025 EV6 will be available in Light (RWD only), Light Long Range (RWD or AWD), Wind (RWD or AWD), GT-Line (RWD or AWD), and GT (AWD) trims. The automaker says it's expected to go on sale in the first half of next year. Pricing and other specs will be announced at a later date.</p>, <p>All in all, the 2025 model year represents a big upgrade for one of the best-equipped, best-looking and best-performing EVs in its class. Expect more on this as we get it. </p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: 2025 Kia EV6            </h2>, <p><em>Contact the author: <a>patrick.george@insideevs.com</a></em></p>, <p>More Kia EV6</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Hyundai, Kia Recall Over 200,000 EVs Because They Might Lose Power While Driving</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

Those models ended up defining BMW and shaping its image into what we know today, so the new Neue Klasse line, which will debut with an iX3 replacement in 2025, is seen as similarly pivotal for the company.</p>, <p>The automaker is erecting (or upgrading) factories around the world to build Neue Klasse vehicles, <a>one of which is in Debrecen, Hungary</a>. This brand-new plant has already started to build its first pre-production test vehicles, and it will soon begin to ramp up production, expecting to build the first customer vehicles in the latter part of next year.</p>, <p>But we don’t have to wait until then to see what the electric SUV codenamed NA5 will look like because its production body was fully revealed via leaked patent drawings. <em>Autoweek</em> published the images last week, and they show a vehicle that closely resembles <a>the Vision Neue Klasse X</a>, but it’s also considerably toned down and less aggressive.</p>, <h3>Cookie Settings</h3>, <p>This content is blocked by security settings.</p>, <p>Please click on button for showing it.</p>, <p>Neue Klasse is the name of BMW’s new modular platform that will gradually phase out CLAR, the architecture used to underpin all the manufacturer's models from <a>the 2 Series coupe</a> to its largest offering, <a>the X7</a>. CLAR-based BMWs will remain in production until around the end of the decade, but the plan is for Neue Klasse to be used across the lineup.</p>, <p>We’re not completely sure Neue Klasse is an EV-only platform, though. BMW, like most other European automakers, has announced that it is <a>pushing back the date when it goes pure-electric</a>. BMW must have thought about at least making it possible to make <a>range-extender EVs</a> on the new platform, given that they seem to be rapidly growing in popularity. The company also has experience making EREVs after building <a>the i3 Rex</a> for several years.</p>, <p>More On This</p>, <p>Last year, <a>BMW</a> optimistically announced that it was going to achieve <a>its goal of selling 50% EVs</a> well before the self-imposed deadline of 2030. Now that seems unlikely, with EV sales not hitting predicted levels in most markets outside China, which is the only large market where electrification really seems to have taken off.</p>, <p>BMW is also investing $800 million to expand its plant in Mexico, which currently builds the CLAR-based 3 Series. The factory will begin building the same iX3-replacing electric SUV that just rolled off the production line in Hungary, but around two years later, in 2027. Additional Neue Klasse models will likely be produced in both factories in the next few years.</p>, <p>New generations of BMWs will also be built on the CLAR architecture, so the transition to Neue Klasse won’t be sudden. We’ve already seen spy photos of the next-generation combustion engine 3 Series codenamed G50, which will ride on an updated version of the platform that underpins the current model when it debuts around 2027. It will be sold alongside the pure-electric i3 previewed by <a>the Vision Neue Klasse concept</a>.</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Tesla Model 3 Performance VS.

They have been promised by battery manufacturers and automakers alike for at least a decade, but as it stands today, you still can’t walk into a showroom that sells electric vehicles and buy a car with a solid-state battery.</p>, <p>Small runs of prototype cells are already rolling off production lines across the world, but mass production is where things get complicated. That said, technology is moving at breakneck speed and several companies are promising we’ll be able to buy and drive an EV with solid-state batteries by the decade’s end.</p>, <p>One of those companies is <a>Honda</a>. The maker of the <a>Prologue</a>–which, admittedly, is made by <a>General Motors</a>–has built a life-size factory to demonstrate how it can manufacture all-solid-state batteries.</p>, <p>More Solid-State Battery Stories</p>, <p>With a floor area of nearly 300,000 square feet, the demo line is located on Honda’s property in Sakura City, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. It has all the equipment needed to start the verification phase of each production process in preparation for the big leap. </p>, <p>That will happen sooner rather than later, which is excellent news. Honda says it will begin making actual batteries on this demo line in January 2025. However, these won’t make it into any EV; instead, these will be used to figure out what needs fixing before moving on to full-scale manufacturing in the following years.</p>, <p>Honda claims its first all-solid-state EVs will hit the market in the second half of the 2020s–that’s just one to four years away. The Japanese automaker’s might coincide with Stellantis’ plan to launch <a>a demonstration fleet of Dodge Charger EVs</a> with Factorial’s semi-solid-state batteries by 2026. Other companies like <a>QuantumScape</a>, <a>Nissan</a> and even <a>Toyota</a> are also working hard to bring solid-state batteries to mass production.</p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: Honda Demonstration Production Line for All-Solid-State Batteries            </h2>, <p>Honda’s approach to the potentially groundbreaking battery tech is to use conventional production processes that were originally designed for liquid lithium-ion batteries. However, the automaker’s research and development team adopted a roll-pressing technique which will help to achieve denser solid electrolyte layers. It also enables Honda to deploy continuous pressing rather than making solid electrolytes in smaller batches.</p>, <p>\"The all-solid-state battery is an innovative technology that will be a game changer in this EV era,” said  Keiji Otsu, President and Representative Director of Honda R&amp;D. “Replacing engines that have been supporting the advancements of automobiles to date, batteries will be the key factor of electrification. We believe that [the] advancement of batteries will be a driving force in the transformation of Honda. Now, the start of operation of our demonstration production line for our all-solid-state batteries is in sight, and we can say that we have reached an important milestone for Honda and the country of Japan.\"</p>, <p>Honda’s EV plans in the United States have already started with GM’s help, and <a>the Prologue is doing quite well here</a>, but the long game includes several self-developed models part of a new line known as the Honda 0 Series.

The upcoming Hyundai Ioniq 9, revealed on Wednesday, will come from the factory with the Tesla-designed North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug. </p>, <p>That means <a>Ioniq 9</a> drivers will be able to visit <a>Tesla's abundant and acclaimed charging stations</a> without the need for a pesky adapter. The vast majority of other non-Tesla EVs, even ones that can technically access Superchargers now, use the Combined Charging System (CCS), which is quickly becoming the antiquated standard.</p>, <p>Owners of those EVs need to a CCS-to-NACS adapter if they want to charge at the thousands of Tesla Superchargers that blanket the country. </p>, <p>The Tesla NACS Transition</p>, <p>All major automakers have <a>announced they're switching over to NACS</a> and getting Supercharger access in return. Historically, only Teslas could access Superchargers, and that was a huge selling point for the brand. Tesla spent years building out the largest and, by many accounts, the most reliable and easy to use EV charging network.</p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9            </h2>, <p>Now other companies have inked deals to grant their EVs access to that walled garden. But those plans are moving slower than expected, and not every firm is at the same stage in the process. <a>Ford</a>, <a>Rivian</a>,  <a>General Motors</a>, <a>Hyundai</a>, <a>Volvo and Polestar</a> all have access to the network now. But so far, that's only been possible using adapters. <a>Hyundai's 2025 Ioniq 5 crossover</a> is the first non-Tesla EV to go on sale with a built-in NACS port, and it will hit dealerships later this year. </p>, <p>The Ioniq 9, a three-row bigger brother to the 5, will go on sale next spring. Of course, native NACS is a double-edged sword, given that the industry is still very much in-between standards. Owners may still have to use a dongle to plug in at non-Tesla stations. </p>, <p><em>Contact the author: <a>tim.levin@insideevs.com</a> </em></p>, <p>More Of Today's EV News</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Hyundai Ioniq 9: A Three-Row EV With 335 Miles Of Range And A Tesla Plug</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

        "html": "[<p>Chime in with article commenting.</p>, <h1>Hyundai Ioniq 9: A Three-Row EV With 335 Miles Of Range And A Tesla Plug</h1>, <h2>\n                We tour the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the latest entry into the growing world of electric family-haulers—and maybe the most enticing one yet.            </h2>, <p>If you’ve been hunting for an electric three-row SUV but never loved any of the choices available, you’re not alone. The Rivian R1S and Tesla Model X have their compromises, and while we love the Kia EV9, some variety would be nice too. </p>, <p>The situation is improving, thanks again to the Hyundai Motor Group. Following the home run it scored with the EV9, the <a>Hyundai Ioniq 9</a> makes its debut as the newest and largest addition to its acclaimed Ioniq family of EVs. </p>, <p>2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9</p>, <p>The Ioniq 9 builds on what makes its smaller siblings great: long ranges, fast charging and head-turning design. It’s just all in a bigger package that, for better or worse, American families increasingly crave. </p>, <p>And it's more than just a re-badged and re-bodied EV9 this time. It beats the EV9 on range and even comes with the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug right out of the gate, so it'll be ready to use the thousands of Supercharger stations out there on the next family road trip. </p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>The Basics</h2>, <p>First came the <a>Ioniq 5</a> as a compact crossover aimed at the <a>Tesla Model Y</a>. Then Hyundai launched the <a>Ioniq 6</a>, a streamlined sedan with epic efficiency and range. Hyundai’s third U.S.-market EV on its modern E-GMP platform is the Ioniq 9. It offers up to seven seats and is an electric alternative to the Hyundai Palisade. </p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9            </h2>, <p>It’s part of Hyundai’s plan to have a lineup of 23 electric models by 2030. It goes into production this coming spring at Hyundai’s Georgia plant, so the automaker expects it to qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit, which requires vehicles to be assembled in North America. (That is, <a>if that policy still exists</a> when the vehicle goes on sale.)</p>, <p>Hyundai hasn’t announced pricing yet, only saying it will be “competitive.” Given that the EV9 starts at around $55,000, somewhere around there is probably a good guess. It’ll cost a lot more than a Palisade or Santa Fe, I can tell you that much. </p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>Range, Charging and Other Specs</h2>, <p>Hyundai is targeting an Environmental Protection Agency range rating of up to 335 miles, which is <a>well above average</a> and sure to dampen some buyers’ range anxiety. Even more impressively, the brand says that no matter what Ioniq 9 trim you buy, it’ll be rated for at least 300 miles. The same can’t be said of its cousin, the EV9, which is good for anywhere from 230 to 304 miles, depending on the trim. </p>, <p>2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9</p>, <p>Much of that has to do with the Ioniq 9’s 110.3 kilowatt-hour, nickel-cobalt-manganese battery, which is about 10% larger than the largest pack available in the EV9. Long range and super-fast charging is a winning combination, and that’s just what the Ioniq 9 serves up. Hyundai says the 9 will be able to recharge from 10%-80% in 24 minutes on a sufficiently powerful plug, thanks to its 800-volt architecture. And it comes from the factory with Tesla’s NACS plug design. So owners will be able to plug in at some 17,000 Tesla Superchargers without needing to use an adapter. </p>, <p>The NACS Rollout</p>, <p>Every major automaker is <a>switching</a> <a>over</a> <a>to</a> <a>NACS</a> from the Combined Charging System, the current standard, but Hyundai is ahead of the curve. Other automakers are still <a>putting out new or updated models</a> with the old charging port, necessitating the use of a dongle at Superchargers. </p>, <p>There will be three powertrain options on offer. The Long-Range RWD is the range champion, while the Performance AWD is the quickest. The AWD Long Range fits in the middle. </p>, <p>Here’s how they break down:</p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>Interior and Design </h2>, <p>At first glance, the Ioniq 9 gives off minivan vibes. I mean this in a good way; the 9 lacks the standard upright boxiness of other big SUVs and that gives it a striking presence. Its short hood, steep windshield and curving roofline give it a sleek, unique look. Just like on other Ioniq models, the exterior is dotted with hundreds of little squares, or “pixels,” that tie together the otherwise disparate-looking EVs. </p>, <p>And a stretched-out wheelbase—the longest of any Hyundai model—creates plenty of room to stretch out inside. Of course, as a three-row SUV, the Ioniq 9’s main selling point is how much stuff and people you can fit inside. </p>, <p>2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9</p>, <p>The Ioniq 9’s cabin does indeed feel huge, as I learned when I got a preview of the model earlier this month. It has a flat floor throughout, which frees up room for your feet, particularly in the middle seat. The second row is downright cavernous and can be optioned with either a three-seat bench or reclining captain’s chairs. The third row is totally usable, even for adults. When I crawled back there, I didn’t feel cramped in the legroom or headroom departments. </p>, <p>The Kia EV9</p>, <p>One fun touch up front is the addition of a sliding center console. So when you want extra room between the front seats for a purse or something, you can slide the unit backward. When you need more room in the rear, you can shift it forward. A similar feature is also available in the Ioniq 5. </p>, <p>Up front, the 9 offers high-output, 100-watt USB-C ports that get their power straight from the high-voltage battery. That’s in addition to <a>vehicle-to-load</a>, or V2L, a feature that lets owners use the Ioniq 9 as a mobile battery pack to power practically anything. </p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>Tech</h2>, <p>The Ioniq 9 has the same dual-screen setup that’s shared with other Kia and Hyundai EVs. In this one, though, it’s curved rather than flat, which is a nice touch. Both the driver-facing cluster and the main screen come in at 12 inches. And the system can handle over-the-air software updates, just like previous models.</p>, <p>2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9</p>, <p> What’s new here is something called “Features on Demand,” an in-vehicle store where owners can buy “digital upgrades” for their cars. It’s debuting with a few options: some lighting signatures for opening or closing the doors, new themes for the displays, and streaming services like Amazon Music and Soundcloud. </p>, <p>Don’t worry—Hyundai says paying to activate one's heated seats is off the table. </p>, <h2><span><svg><use></use></svg></span>Should You Buy This Or The EV9?</h2>, <p>2024 Kia EV9</p>, <p>We won’t know for sure until we can get the Ioniq 9 out on the road and spend some quality time with it. But it’s mostly a question of design preference. These two SUVs share a platform, they’re both big and spacious, and their user interfaces will feel similar too. The Ioniq 9 has the firm edge on range, though, which may be the deciding factor for some folks. And we know that the EV9 will soon pack the NACS port as well, along with an adapter for the existing cars. </p>, <p>At the end of the day, it’s just great to see another solid electric option for bigger families. </p>, <p><em>Contact the author: <a>tim.levin@insideevs.com</a> </em></p>, <p>More EV News</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>The Hyundai Ioniq 9 Will Come With Tesla's NACS Plug</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

But all that hate may be misplaced.            </h2>, <p>It seems like the fruits of Jaguar’s new rebrand may just pay off.</p>, <p>Hot on the heels of a controversial advertisement and<a> announcement of new logos and typeface,</a> the storied British sports car and sedan brand has shown off a cryptic look at its first model in an EV future, with an announcement that we’ll soon learn more on Dec. 2 in Miami.</p>, <p>The teaser doesn’t show a lot, but we can ascertain a surprisingly high amount of information from what appears to be a cropped dead-on rear photo of an aqua-colored car against a bright pink background. The mystery Jaguar is very wide, appearing to have a sports car-like width that houses the car’s wide tires. The car’s lines are interestingly rectilinear, a dramatic change from the organic flowing shapes of Jaguar’s now-discontinued ICE and EV models.</p>, <h3>Cookie Settings</h3>, <p>This content is blocked by security settings.</p>, <p>Please click on button for showing it.</p>, <p>What few curves there are in the car’s haunches are offset by the car’s straight line and simplistic cutouts for what could be a rear grille or rear window. Whatever the case, it’s certainly a huge departure from whatever Jaguar was doing before today.</p>, <p>Jaguar Commercial Screenshot</p>, <p>For those not in the know, Jaguar just previewed a provocative new advertising campaign that signaled a relaunch and rebranding of the classic British brand. It featured a high-contrast color palette, along with young high-fashion models in androgynous garments that feel reminiscent of designs from the late, great Alexander McQueen. The advertisement didn’t show a car or a timeline—just a tagline that said “copy nothing,\" which is actually a callback to a famous saying from Jaguar's founder.</p>, <p>The campaign felt as if Jaguar had somehow become a fashion brand under LVMH selling skincare or handbags rather than cars. </p>, <h3>Cookie Settings</h3>, <p>This content is blocked by security settings.</p>, <p>Please click on button for showing it.</p>, <p><br/>The ad’s reception has been pretty controversial. Some have praised Jaguar for taking a chance and attempting to set itself apart in a premium EV world, while others think the company should have focused on introducing a car—especially since Jaguar is <a>killing its entire lineup of vehicles</a> (including its lone EV) until its new models are introduced.</p>, <p>But the ad's inclusion of diverse faces and bodies has put Jaguar right in the crosshairs of the culture wars. Fox News called it \"Bud Light 2.0\" On X, the social media network owned by Elon Musk with an algorithm now keenly dialed in to reflect his politics, some have insisted that Jaguar’s ad is a symptom of everything wrong with society, that the mere presence of models in dresses means that Jaguar is done for.</p>, <p>Those seem like strange critiques to anyone who has paid any attention to the fashion industry. Jaguar's new direction feels pretty much in line with any luxury fashion house marketing campaign from any point in time from 2021 onward. That's clearly the vibe Jaguar is going for now, and probably must, since the cars are slated to cost at least $120,000. </p>, <p>A lot of the hate comments tend to revolve around a bygone era of Jaguar, one that they think catered to \"rich men\" intrested in the old-style, stodgy designs like the pre-2010 Jaguar XJ. But those designs, that marketing—it just wasn't working. In 2023, Jaguar sold a whopping 8,438 cars. By comparison, Genesis sold 68,798 vehicles that same year. Clearly, Jaguar was in bad need of a shake-up.</p>, <p>Whatever you feel, you can’t deny that it certainly got people talking about Jaguar in ways that its old cars never, ever did. Searches for Jaguar are up dramatically since it pulled this marketing stunt. Maybe Jaguar knows something we don’t, and it’ll pay off in the long run.</p>, <p>Jaguar’s next vehicle, which is likely a concept car, will be unveiled in early December. Is Jaguar's new direction misguided? Well, we'll just have to wait and see. </p>, <p><em>Contact the author: <a>kevin.williams@insideevs.com</a></em></p>, <p>More EV News</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Here's The $634 Million Electric Jaguar That Died At The Last Minute</span></p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

Nevertheless, the wheels of progress keep turning, right? The Sino-Swedish brand Zeekr is continuing its quest for growth in markets outside of China by growing its model lineup. According to new photos, the 7x luxury compact crossover is next on the docket for European expansion.</p>, <p>Photographed in the midst of validation testing, this all-black crossover looks pretty much identical to the version already on sale in China. There are a few differences. For example, the wheels on this test unit are different from the ones found on the Zeekr 7x on Chinese roads. Also, this unit appears to be missing the customizable light-up Stargate panel that we’ve seen <a>on the Zeekr 007.</a> To be fair, it is optional on Chinese models. </p>, <p>Remember, the Zeekr 7x uses the same SEA platform that’s underpinning a plethora of new EVs made by Geely and its associated brands. This means the 7x effectively is a mechanical sibling to the <a>Polestar 4,</a> Zeekr 001, Zeekr 007, <a>and a gaggle of new Smart-branded EVs</a> that thus far only exist in Europe and China. </p>, <p>However, it appears that the 7x tends to favor the 007 out of all of them. Upon launch, the 7x got the same 800-volt architecture as the 007, unlike the older 400-volt architecture that underpins the Polestar 4 and export versions of the Zeekr 001. When coupled with Zeekr’s 75 kWh Golden Battery, <a>the brand claims it can sprint from 10-80% in under 11 minutes.</a></p>, <p>Now, there’s no news as to what changes the 7x will have before it enters the European market. But, if it does keep the 800-volt architecture and 75 kWh LFP battery, the 7x could end up being one of the fastest-charging vehicles on sale in Europe. </p>, <p>Of course, we don’t know what price the 7x will take. In China, the 7x significantly undercuts EV crossovers from brands like BMW, which costs only about $31,000 for a base single-motor 7x. However, imported Zeekrs are subject to an additional 19.9% tariff (not including the 10% already added in), which naturally will raise the price. Also, it’s not uncommon for Chinese manufacturers to raise the price for export markets. <a>The Zeekr X</a> (mechanical<a> twin to the Volvo EX30</a>) starts at about $45,000 USD, significantly more than the roughly $23,000 an equivalent version would cost in China. The 7x is likely to be somewhat more expensive than the subcompact Zeekr X.</p>, <p>The Zeekr 7x will likely go on sale in Europe before the end of next year.</p>, <p>Contact the author: kevin.williams@insideevs.com</p>, <p>More EV News</p>, <h3>Top comments</h3>, <h3>Trending</h3>, <h6>Ownership Experience</h6>, <p>What's it like to own an EV?</p>, <h6>Buying Tips</h6>, <p>Need some EV buying advice? </p>, <h6>Deals</h6>, <p>Discover deals on EVs here.</p>, <p>latest articles</p>, <p>RECOMMENDED FOR YOU</p>, <p><span>Volkswagen ID.

Now, a lot more people might notice it soon, as it's found at Tesla Supercharger stations. </p>, <p>This is the 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70. It’s not a completely new model but rather a subtle facelift that also brings a couple of notable changes under the skin. One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a native NACS charging port at the front of the EV. The location of the port isn’t new–the outgoing model’s CCS1 port was also at the front–but the native NACS is new and makes the <a>Electrified GV70</a> the first EV in the Genesis lineup to come with one from the factory.</p>, <p>2026 Genesis GV70 Electrified Tesla NACS</p>, <p>As a reminder, NACS means North American Charging Standard. It’s <a>Tesla</a>’s invention and it means the 2026 Electrified GV70 will be able to recharge at Tesla Superchargers in North America without using a charging adapter. However, <a>Genesis</a> said customers will get an NACS to CCS adapter to top up their EVs at CCS DC fast chargers. Combined, there are over 36,000 NACS and CCS DC fast chargers in the United States, so going on long road trips shouldn’t be a daunting experience anymore.</p>, <p>More Genesis Stuff (Not The Band)</p>, <p>Besides switching from CCS to NACS, Genesis added a motor to the charging port door (it previously used a manual release), as well as a heating element to the charging port to help with de-icing during cold months. There’s also new lighting to make it easier to see what you’re doing while parked in dark places.</p>, <p>The second notable change is a bigger battery under the floor. The outgoing model had a 77.4-kilowatt-hour pack that enabled an EPA-estimated range of 236 miles on a full charge. The 2026 model comes with a larger 84 kWh battery that should provide a longer driving range, but there’s no official rating yet. Power remains unchanged, with a dual-motor setup good for 429 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>Several design changes have been made, including a redesigned G-Matrix Crest Grille and multi-lens array (MLA) headlamps. There’s also a refreshed skid plate design and new 19- and 21-inch wheels. Inside, there’s an all-new 27-inch OLED display that integrates both the instrument cluster and infotainment.</p>, <h2>\n                Gallery: 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70            </h2>, <p>The facelifted Electrified GV70 now responds quicker and better to voice commands, according to the Korean automaker. There are also improved over-the-air update capabilities, but we don’t know what that means, exactly.</p>, <p>The 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 is manufactured in South Korea but Hyundai Motor Group’s plant in Alabama is responsible for the final assembly. Genesis says the EV is “dual-sourced at the brand’s production facilities in Montgomery, Alabama and Ulsan, Korea.” </p>, <p>The refreshed all-electric SUV will arrive at North American retailers in the first half of 2025.
