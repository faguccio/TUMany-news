Indeed, as our own Conor Knell discovered during a test drive, the abrupt plunge from 70 to a 50 mph restriction is a reliable giveaway of who’s local and who’s not.</p>, <p>Newcomers, he found, slam on their brakes in anticipation of imminent speed cameras while regulars steam on by, treating the legal limits as mere guidelines. It seems worlds away from Coventry's rigorous streets where a host of average speed cameras rigorously enforce motoring discipline.</p>, <p>Coventry motorists opened up about their experiences, with Conan the Mermaid reflecting: \"All the cars that I have driven in my 70+ years show the speed to be approximately 10% greater than the actual. This means when you think you are doing 50, you're doing only 45. Thus the glares from the impatient others. Hope this helps.\"</p>, <p><b>READ MORE: <a>Tribute to 'devoted' dad in Coventry's death and funeral notices this week</a></b></p>, <p>PERCY adds: \"Yep driven down there and all cars pass me. We need average speed cameras on as many roads as possible. The difference is noticeable straight away, .and all you who hate them, carry on speeding, pay your fine then we'll get more cameras, win win.\"</p>, <p>Mxlerone writes: \"What's weird is that when they were building the new tollbar roundabout and flyover, that 50mph section had average speed cameras put in place and everything worked fine (or you received a fine). For some reason it must have been decided to allow the road to descend into anarchy through their removal instead.\"</p>, <p>Kenpas says: \"The reason the speed limit is 50mph on that part of the A46/A45, is the bend under the Toll Bar junction, as speeding vehicles are in danger of overturning under the junction. Also there is parking places built along that stretch for the mobile speed cameras to park up. I haven't seen any mobile cameras on it yet!!\"</p>, <p>Disorganised1 adds: \"Just drive around the ring road. I get overtaken daily driving at the speed limit, and on both sides of the car - often by private hire cars.\"</p>, <p>Mikehf comments: \"Never have any problem sticking to the speed limit.\"</p>, <p>Destroyedcountry believes: \"Oh dear, anyone with a inch of common sense would never have set the speed limits as they are!\"</p>, <p>Over on our <a>Facebook page</a> - Belle Barnes says: \"Excellent point and I don’t know why it’s not been called out before. I regularly drive on that road and I too follow the speed limit signs. They are there for a reason so when you feel like your the one in the wrong, the truth is that everyone else driving at 60/70 mph are in the wrong. I agree, it’s an accident waiting to happen. Maybe this article will make the highways agency or whoever deals with our roads, sort it out once and for all.\"</p>, <p>While Saucey Sue adds: \"The 50mph stretch is round by the jaguar and A444/<a>Warwick</a> bypass where there are multiple lanes for different places, similar to the picture of the article above, as well as slip roads joining. It’s by far safer to reduce the speed limit than having everyone trying to achieve national speed limit whilst also trying to be in the correct lane. I guarantee there’d be people screaming about the number of accidents if the speed limit was 70. And remember people, a speed limit is not a target, it’s a maximum speed allowed.\"</p>, <p>Vicki Walls-Gilbert thinks: \"Well if you’re driving to the letter of the law you’ll be in the left hand lane and not be holding up anyone who wishes to speed as you’ll pull over as soon as you’ve over taken. Which leaves a lane free for the speedsters! You will also not travel in the right hand lane for miles, not over taking anything, often travelling way below the speed limit simply because you haven’t got the balls to change into the right hand lane as you approach your junction to turn right.\"</p>, <p><b>So do you believe that the limit is correct? Let us know <a>HERE</a> or in the comments below.</b></p>, <p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p>, <h4>Follow us<ul><li><span>Follow us</span></li><li><a></a></li><li><a></a></li><li><a></a></li><li><a></a></li></ul></h4>, <p></p>]"

        "html": "[<h2>Support the Guardian</h2>, <h1>Electric shock: carmakers battle strict UK electric car rules as big fines loom</h1>, <p>As Ford announced cutting 800 UK jobs it said rules forcing companies to sell more EVs each year are ‘unworkable’ </p>, <p><span>W</span>hen Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the <a>zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate</a>, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.</p>, <p>Someone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker <a>strongly backed the policy</a>. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.</p>, <p>“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”</p>, <p>The carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the <a>Fast Charge newsletter</a>. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.</p>, <p>During the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit <a>amid problems in getting parts</a>). That has changed now. Carmakers are <a>not experiencing the expected demand</a> for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.</p>, <p>Demand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over <a>public charger numbers</a>, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if <a>much cheaper in the long run</a>) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.</p>, <p>The carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.</p>, <p>Under the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.</p>, <p>The mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter <a>Tom Allen</a>.</p>, <p>For the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.</p>, <p>The Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the <a>Vauxhall</a>, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could <a>close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton</a> because of the mandate.</p>, <p>Yet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.</p>, <p>Vicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.</p>, <p>“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”</p>, <p>Sign up to <span>Business Today</span></p>, <p>Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning</p>, <p>after newsletter promotion</p>, <p>It is tricky to work out how much pressure individual carmakers are actually under. The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).</p>, <p>With all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the <a>18.1% electric sales</a> achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.</p>, <p>Ben Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.</p>, <p>Carmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.</p>, <p>The business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.</p>, <p>Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.</p>, <p>“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.</p>, <p>Whatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.</p>, <p>David Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”</p>, <h2>Most viewed</h2>, <h2>Most viewed</h2>]"

        "html": "[<h1>\n\t\t\t\tEU battery hopes in tatters as Northvolt CEO resigns and company files for bankruptcy\t\t\t</h1>, <p>\n\t\t\t\tThe company ran into big problems with production at a time when demand for EVs slumped. \t\t\t</p>, <p>In a huge blow to Europe's plan to set up its own battery industry to power electric cars, Peter Carlsson resigned as CEO of battery-maker Northvolt on Friday morning, shortly after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S.</p>, <p>\"The <a>Chapter 11 filing</a> allows a period during which the company can be reorganized, ramp up operations while honoring customer and supplier commitments, and ultimately position itself for the long-term,\" Carlsson, a former Tesla executive who cofounded Northvolt in 2016, <a>said in a statement</a>.</p>, <p>He will stay on as a senior adviser and remain on the board.</p>, <p>The filing, and departure of its cofounder, marks a swift reversal of fortunes for the company that was set to be Europe's battery champion and chief competitor to the Chinese and other Asian companies that dominate the sector.</p>, <p>“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition.</p>, <p>Northvolt's Swedish subsidiary, Northvolt Ett Expansion, <a>filed an application for bankruptcy </a>in October.</p>, <p>Sweden's government has consistently said it will not step in to save the company. German officials considered <a>getting involved</a>, but the government is cash-strapped and dealing with turmoil in its domestic automotive industry — the same woes that started Northvolt's downfall.</p>, <p>Chinese automaker insiders, meanwhile, are scratching their heads at European leaders' willingness to let Northvolt die, said Cornel Ban, an associate professor at the Copenhagen Business School, who studies electric vehicle investments in China.</p>, <p>“[Northvolt] is our silver bullet in the competition,” he said.</p>, <p>The company managed to create an EV battery without lithium or other critical raw materials that China controls. However, it ran into large problems with overspending, management and production. It was also hit with an unexpected slowdown in EV demand.</p>, <p>\"Why didn't we solve the financing sooner? It was an incredibly complicated game to get bridging financing between different stakeholders. We finally had to give up on that attempt,\" Carlsson <a>told reporters</a>.</p>, <p>He blamed the company's difficulties on starting new production facilities with innovative technology. \"When you start with new products, build a new factory, and hire new employees, you're taking on a significant challenge,\" he said.</p>, <p>While the Chapter 11 filing will allow it to restructure, Northvolt's meteoric rise is over as it struggles to bring in new financing.</p>, <p>Tom Johnstone, the interim chair of Northvolt’s board, said: “This decisive step will allow Northvolt to continue its mission to establish a homegrown, European industrial base for battery production.” </p>, <p>In a remark to reporters, Carlsson said the company needs to raise between $1 billion and $1.2 billion to get the company back on track. By filing for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., it now has access to $145 million in cash collateral and $100 million in new financing from one of its existing customers, the <a>company said</a>.</p>, <p>\"First and foremost, this was necessary to capitalize and drive the company forward,\" Carlsson said. \"Essentially, Northvolt is crucial for both our customers and for Europe's green transition. The recapitalization allows us to emerge from this process with a simpler capital structure.\"</p>, <p>Northvolt's downward spiral began over the summer when BMW canceled a contract worth €2 billion. The next blows came fast, with Volvo saying it would take over its joint venture with Northvolt as soon as it finds an investment partner.</p>, <p>In September, Northvolt <a>announced</a> it was laying off 1,600 people, or a quarter of its workforce in Sweden, and suspending its gigafactory expansion project.</p>, <p>But the biggest setback came from Volkswagen, which is Northvolt's top investor and holds 21 percent of the company. The German automaker is facing <a>a financial crisis</a> of its own with slowing sales in China and negotiations with union workers over layoffs and potential plant closures.</p>, <p>Despite the Chapter 11 filing, the company's flagship gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden, and Northvolt Labs in Västerås, Sweden, will remain operational. Northvolt Germany and Northvolt North America will also continue operating, with the company saying that a C$7 billion factory being planned for Quebec is still on track.</p>, <p>\"There are many questions about the speed of the green transition and Europe's role. It's essential to keep pushing forward,\" Carlsson said. \"We'll regret it in 20 years if we don't accelerate the transition and create a strong European market with strong European champions.\"</p>, <h2>\n<span>\n<svg><path></path></svg>\n</span>\n<span>\n\t\t\t\tOur readers read next\t\t\t</span>\n</h2>, <h2>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrump was ‘obsessed’ by too many German cars in New York, Merkel claims\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h2>, <h2>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope’s economy took another downward lurch in November, survey shows\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n</h2>, <h2>\n<a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLast year, the world pledged to move away from fossil fuels.

However, as part of a mid-life refresh, the maximum power output has jumped to 641bhp and 770Nm of torque when ‘GT’ mode is activated. During everyday driving, there will be 601bhp on tap, and the same 740Nm as before. </p>, <p>Accordingly, performance is likely to be improved. 0-62mph takes just 3.5 seconds in the outgoing EV6 GT, and while Kia has not yet confirmed a figure for the upgraded model, we expect that extra power will have shaved at least a tenth of a second off the already impressive sprint time. </p>, <p>That would enable it to at least match the <a>Hyundai</a> Ioniq 5 N’s 3.4-second 0-62mph sprint, and come close to the <a>Tesla Model 3 Performance</a>’s time of roughly three seconds.</p>, <p>The only other detail Kia has confirmed so far is that the EV6 GT will get a new ‘Virtual Gear Shift’ feature, just like the Ioniq 5 N. It’s designed to create a more engaging driving experience by adjusting the car’s torque output to deliver a small jolt and create the impression of a gear change when you pull on the paddles on the steering wheel. </p>, <p>A synthesised internal combustion engine soundtrack is also pumped into the cabin, which changes as the ‘revs’ climb and the driver shifts. If that doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, in the Ioniq 5 N, both the noises and faux gear changes can be switched off for a more conventional electric car driving experience. </p>, <p>However, Auto Express was told earlier this year that the EV6 GT will not get the Ioniq 5 N’s uprated, stiffer suspension competents, so it’s likely to remain the slightly softer choice of the two. </p>, <p>The EV6 GT will benefit from a new 84kWh battery as well, as every version of the regular <a>Kia</a> EV6 sold in the UK uses this powerpack, which should provide a boost to the outgoing model’s 263-mile range. </p>, <p>Styling and interior changes will mirror those that the regular EV6 received earlier this year, including the new ‘Star Map’ daytime running light design and a revised front end inspired by the flagship <a>Kia EV9</a>. The cabin benefited from a new three-spoke steering wheel, and the firm’s latest infotainment software, which added wireless <a>Android Auto</a> and <a>Apple CarPlay</a>.</p>, <p>The first official images and more details of the new <a>Kia EV6</a> GT are expected to be released before the end of the year, with the model set to hit the road in 2025.</p>, <p><em><strong>Click here for a list of the </strong></em><a><em><strong>fastest SUVs in the world</strong></em></a><em><strong>...</strong></em></p>, <p>As our news reporter, Ellis is responsible for covering everything new and exciting in the motoring world, from quirky quadricycles to luxury MPVs.
